Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low
So who's left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we're gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven, paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror
You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son, but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you're on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

A match made in heaven
Paved the road to hell
We've been down this path before
And every execution, the price of your collusion
You knew all along, that the cancer would spread
So don't be surprised to find a price on your head
Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low
Sunk this low

You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core


Piano wire strangling our necks
We are both silenced
And we're sure this does not add up
Still we try and place our bets
We're sure this does not add up
Still we'redying 
So make the call
Our people versus yours never did make sense
Your people versus mine
Light me up
It's all too much for me
Never did make sense
Come dance with me
We'll go out to sea
The sky was blood red
Images of people dead
Stained with the shadows of our past victims
We're out at sea
Then come and drown with me
We'll float away
Drift away
Our corpses lifeless
Then somehow tell me we made sense


The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
Their spirits are broken, they have nowhere to run.
They dream of courage and a loaded gun,
But the slaves all know, they better bite their tongue.
Track marks across the planet.
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect.

Three cheers for desperation. 
God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, 
To fight, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.

The workers all march to the beat of the drum.
They fell into the trap, taken one by one.
The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb.
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret.
Existence is just something they would rather forget.

Three cheers for desperation. 
God bless the Godforsaken.
We will arm them to the teeth, 
To fight, to fight the war on peace.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.

Is this freedom? Is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low.

All love is lost, so carry the cross.
'Cause there's no human in us left.
We are music made for the deaf.
They play a game that they know they'll never win.
Sick and tired of the world they're living in.
The messiah showed up high on heroin, on heroin.


Son of God, hangman's pawn
control our lives
with fairy tales and shallow lies.
You say we'll burn in hell,
spiteful preacher, I know you well.

Desperation breathes and follows you home,
Look around, you're not alone.
One life and one chance, 
the world in front of me.

Intelligent design, sending shivers down my spine.
Cells mutate and divide,
what a sadistic intention.
No light, no dark, no ups, no downs.
I'll find peace buried in the ground.
The lights go out, the fuse has blown,
no Heaven or Hell to bring me home.
You say we'll burn in hell,
spiteful preacher, I know you well.

Desperation breathes and follows you home,
Look around, you're not alone.
One life and one chance, 
the world in front of me.

Another division to tear us apart,
Try to fill that hole inside your heart.
Another division to tear us apart,
Try to fill that hole inside your heart.

Son of God, sun in the sky,
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye" 
(There's more to me, more to me)

Son of God, sun in the sky,
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye" 
(There's more to me, more to me)

Let me say my decency, come from the inside.
Just human heart, a decent mind.
We all slip up from time to time.

Let me say my decency, come from the inside.
Just human heart, a decent mind.
We all slip up from time to time.


If only you were here to hold my head above bloody waters
We could make it through
You turned your back on me and now I do the same to you
You made me feel so hollow
How can the man that you looked up to turn around and say three words that hurt more than you'll ever know
You don't know what it feels like to be in my shoes
You turned your back on me as I stood there and fell to the floor
This time there's no reason for me to turn around and scream for help
But if only you were here to hold my head above all those things you said to tie me down
I'm looking for forgiveness for something that I didn't even do
How can you call yourself and idol, a person to trust?
How can I look so high up when you're always holding me down?


Always the one with a face on
Always the one with never enough
He was the boy that broke your trust
Because he was never around enough
We sit around and hear these stories
Wishing we were somewhere else
How I wish that I could find the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

I was the one with the face on
I was the one with never enough
I was the boy that broke your trust
Because I was never around enough
I sit around and tell these stories
Wishing I was somewhere else
Oh how I wish I found the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend

I wish I found the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out
Find the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out, out

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again
When will we see you again




Sowing the seeds.
Roots dig deep, whilst we sleep.
Snakes in veins, valves decay.
All of the meaningless words we say.

Cast the first stone, from behind the throne.
Crown of thorns, now overgrown.
All our wants and needs, bring us to our knees.
Can't turn back now the seeds are sown.

Seven billion, one of a kind.
Collide together, intertwined.
National lines used to define,
where we draw the enemy lines.

Weapons aren't used in this war.
Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought.
All the things we can't afford to ignore.
The sun doesn't shine anymore.


We're found a taste for selfdestruction
A blind eye for blatant disfunction
We're found a taste for selfdestruction
We're all born in black blood!

There's an imminence stirring like a siren singing
There's a debt to pay but they keep on drilling
Why simple truth so hard to tell
We had an Eden and turned it into hell

Born in black blood!

Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget.
I can't forgive, we won't forget!

The lonely sound of the final drip
Like the starting gun marking the end of it
On the shoulders of forever it's a long way to fall
Black gold will be the death, the death of us all
Black drought, word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled

Born in black blood!

Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget.
I can't forgive, we won't forget!

Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive, we won't forget.
I can't forgive, we won't forget!

BRAH!

Black drought, word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled
We've found the cancer inside of our heads
There's no turning back now, we're as good as dead

When the well dried up no one cared
But when the hell shows up, they'll all stop and stare
[x2]

We've found the cancer inside of our heads
No turning back now, we're as good as dead
[x2]

I can't forgive, we won't forget!
I can't forgive, we won't forget!
I can't forgive, we won't forget!
I can't forgive, we won't forget!


Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags

You said "see lookit, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers"

And I said I know it well

That secret that you knew
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good, girl
'Cause its running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar

You said "ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well

That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I said I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well
And I know it well


We are currently missing these lyrics.


I'm looking back on a time when i could say I actually thought I cared about you
But after everything I've been put though
I realise that I've been living with false hope
It's drowning out my senses
It's drowning out my thoughts 
This has got oh so confusing 
And i've only got myself to blame 
I can't believe...oh what was I thinking
I've only got my self to blame
You mean nothing to me
And you never fucking did
I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore
I can only pray that you feel so alone
A guilty conscience hangs over your head
I can't believe...oh what was i thinking
I've only got myself to blame
But maybe I'm the only one to blame in all of this
I've got nothing to depend on anymore


Falling into stringencies
I never thought that I would be here
Dependence on, the evenings
I'm out of touch

It's too late to hide what you kept hid
What explains with (words / were crooks)
I'm falling out,
I'm falling out,
Of touch, with myself


I felt like this since forever
(This is killing me)
I felt like this since forever
(This is killing, me)

What escaped
Was what I dreamt then
Blurry eyes
[Send/sell] the stories
I'm broke apart
Fading hours
Empty dreams

Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends
Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends

[What were/I wore] the same routines over every fucking night
I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships, I've...

I've felt like this since forever
(This is killing me)
I felt like this since forever
(This is killing, me)
This is killing me

Lift me up from this
Never ending fear of myself
Dependence on the evenings
To get me through
Show me the [line/lie]
I can't just walk away

How much longer
Can I break the same routines
Blurry eyes      
(Broken clocks)
Fading hours
How much longer
Can I break the same routines
Blurry eyes
(Broken clocks)
Fading hours

Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends
Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends


God only knows why we were born to burn 

If God is my witness, He'll see that all is not well  
Christ, what a sight for sore eyes 
Looking down on us, all the children that You despise  

God only knows why we were born to burn
God only knows why we were born to burn

A bullet in the neck doesn't feel much like love  
A message of rejection sent from above 
No flags, no holy books 
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood 

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget  
A desperate picture of God's regret  
Are we perfect mistakes? 
Or almighty fuck ups? 
One thing's for sure, He doesn't fucking love us  
He doesn't fucking love us

Hate must weigh on you like a broken cross 
Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across  

Outcast and reject  
Outcast and reject

Father, Father, how I've let you down 
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown
Father, father, how I've let you down 
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown

The sons and daughters that you wished to forget 
A desperate picture of God's regret 
Are we perfect mistakes? 
Or almighty fuck ups?  
One thing's for sure, He doesn't fucking love us  
He doesn't fucking love us
He doesn't fucking love us


It's run down
The back of my head
The back of my mind
About a hundred thousand times
And I can't
Seem to shake it
Seem to shake it 
Addiction's tying me down

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before
I've been through this patch before

I'm lost and alone in my head
And I can't make sense of myself
I need to find a simple away
To make this pain just disappear
I know I'll never feel
Safe in my own skin

Pull me under
I can't take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before

No matter how long I'm gone for
It's at the back of my mind
Another sleepless night
Somebody get me home

I'm so far down
And there's anyone can say to me
I'm so down, I'm so down

You've got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
I've been through this patch before


Send my regards to you and yours
I'm not coming back for you
And I'll hold onto the last memory of you
I'll hold onto you and bury you at sea
How can you watch me split in two?
You've done this before, you know me oh too well
Send my regards to you and yours
And no hope will come from this
So turn around and run
How can you smile when you see me crumbling?
And we all stood back and watched the waves crash down on you
Send my regards to you and yours
And there's no hope for someone as cold as you
You made me sink into the coldest of waves
I watch you sink into lies that you created


Oh!

No one knows permanence quite like you
There's a ruthlessness in all that you do
This is not about what we deserve
There's no bias in the misery served

C.A.N.C.E.R!

So watch the sun sink into the sea
There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me!

When we all fade away
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss

Respected will we be at the end of this

Urgh!

I feel it now more than ever
A reaper's watch
My life ready to sever!

Your name carries more than disease
A symbol of man brought to his knees
This is not about what we deserve
There's no bias in the misery served

C.A.N.C.E.R!

(When we all fade away)
(And this world can't bare another day)
(There will be no fight in broken bliss)

Find a little light and hold it close
Don't lose sight, don't lose sight of what matters most!

This is a burden we all carry together
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never!

When we all fade away,
And this world can't bare another day
There will be no fight in broken bliss.

Respected will we be at the end of this

So watch the sun sink into the sea
There is a perfect peace but don't wait up for me!

C.A.N.C.E.R!
C.A.N.C.E.R!

This is a burden we all carry together!
Waiting in the wings, so we never say never!!!


This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

I've made promises that I know I can't keep.
Drink from the holy grail, you'll find it's bittersweet.
No matter what he says, poison is not my friend.
But he'll have my back until the bitter end.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.
This is the be all, the end all.
The burden, the blessing.

All my mistakes will outlive me.
I just can't accept that what will be, will be.
My lungs are failing, I can't catch my breath.
I don't know why, but right now I'm scared to death.

My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

Always climbing but only ever descending.
The canvas before me is never-ending.

So call for the crossroads if you're lost in the woods.
If I drop this torch then I'll be gone for good.
I said "enough is enough".
Well I guess I lied, I guess I lied.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.

This is the path I chose. This is the path I chose.

I wasted time building castles in the air.
If there's peace to be found, I won't find it there.
My fear still sees when my eyes are closed.
But the blame's on me, this is the path I chose.


Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
We brought the battle, we saw the signs,
We've found ourselves two steps behind.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.
(pray for drought)

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. 
This is colony collapse.

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose.
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold.
We were warned but we wouldn't be told.

I'm counting days like they're running out.
There's ghosts in the water, so pray for drought.

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. This is colony collapse.
Colony collapse.

Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.
Dear, oh dear, what a sorry state we're in.

They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

This time there's nowhere to hide.
We're facing the firing squad side by side.
They said the ocean's on fire.
Say it isn't true. 
Say it isn't true.
The truth never hurt so much.
Can we start anew? Can we start anew?

1986. This is full relapse.
Our latest apocalypse. 
This is colony collapse.


In the bigger picture I've been painted out
Cracks in the earth blacken the sea
No canvas is reserved for me
Look up close and try to see
In every stroke lies past alone

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

You aren't a child fighting in a war
Son please don't tell me that this is bored
Tear your things out from the earth
Long departed we're so short sighted

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat


It could take a second
To tear down years of work
And we won't get these days
Back again (back again)

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted

Someone, tell me how I've ended up here
With nobody watching over me?

We need to bring back the days we used to love
Before all the color drains away

I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me
I can't understand why I've been put here
I'm stuck in a world of sympathy
With nobody watching over me

To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those not living in the here and now
To all those (sing it loud)

Where did they go?
The days we used to know
Where did they go?
Have I forgotten what it feels like?
Where did they go, where did they go
The days we used to know
Where did they go, where did they go

Have I forgotten what it feels like?

And the words roll over and over
Yet our hearts will never be lifted


Navigation in nautical twilight, 
Separation from what we know is right. 
The wind was taking us in the wrong direction, 
It's about time we showed some disaffection.

Carry the weight of thousands of years. 
Turn the page, let's make it all disappear. 
We've had enough of inhibited progression, 
Held back by cloak and dagger oppression. 

We're insulting our own intelligence. 
I won't listen without any evidence. 
I'll live my life in the name of no one. 
Bow your head, palm to palm, 
Worship here in this cerebral cathedral. 

As day breaks, the sunlight heals, 
As day breaks, the light reveals. 

These chains that we've been living in, 
How easily we've been giving in. 
Now shed this skin and let change begin. 

As day breaks, the sunlight heals, 
As day breaks, the light reveals. 

Navigation in nautical twilight, 
Separation from what we know is right. 
It feels to me like this boat is sinking, 
Weighed down by rational thinking.
Light begins to pierce the distance. 
Solar dawn, relieve the friction. 
Blue hours quicken the pulse. 
Upon the upper edge, reality dawns.


These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of God's salvation!
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes, they hung the heroes.

(Oh!)

You've got to watch your back
You've got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks, or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
They struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration,
No promises of God's salvation!
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet.
They hung the heroes, they hung the heroes.

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Would you run and hide? Or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun!

These martyrs seek no adoration,
No promises of God's salvation!
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet.
They hung the heroes, they hung the heroes.

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget, swear that you won't forget!
[x2]


Tell the rats to get back in the gutter. 
We'll be watching, we're always watching!

You try to stamp them out,
You'll only fan the flames!
This is for all the snakes: Fuck! You!
So hold your forked tongues,
You've got us spitting nails!
I'm gonna say it straight: Fuck! You!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won't forget, swear that you won't forget!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun!
They think this spells the end, it's only just begun!


I've watched you from a distance but never spoken a word
I have seen every flaw your try to hide from the world
I sit silent in shadows watching the paths you have made
If only you knew my intentions 
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over
This is not healthy
I need to some how stop this
But your beauty intrigues me
It seems to be pulling me in
All I want is a moment or something I can hold close for eternity 
I've watched you make the same mistakes over and over 
I only you knew my name and all of my motives
Yet I sit in the same place every night and wait for you to come back home
A few moments would help me find myself
But this problem has taken its tragic grip
Just a few moments will help me find myself again
If only you knew my name and all of my motives
I need to somehow stop this
All i need is a moment or something i can hold close for eternity
Something I can hold close to me


There was a time for change,
I fear it came and went.
Who's gonna pick up the pieces?
Who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.
Now there's no turning back.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn, blegh!

Our collapse will be remission.
A planet scarred beyond all recognition.
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path that we've chosen?
Too cowardly to face this, we've got a fucking deathwish!
You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt.
You gave us life, we gave back death in return.
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.

We will consume until there's nothing left.
Remember us as a waste of breath.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn.

I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
We just wanna watch the world burn.

I want to believe that it all counts for something.
The writing is on the wall.
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing.
All for nothing.

Yeah I know you know that we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn.
We just wanna watch the world burn.


We are the misguided youth.
They backed us into a corner.
All our lives we've been infected,
They should have never of had a chance.

Because they're forcing us to believe,
In a world we shouldn't trust.
Delete rewind,
And try to change this state of mind.

Give us something to believe in, 
Give us something to make our own,
Give us something to believe in,
Give us something to make our own.

When we will we stand up and choose our paths?

This is the end of the world,
At least that's what we're told.
This is the end of the world,
Board up your windows and lock the doors.

Turn out the lights, turn out the lights,
Oh, this is getting old.

We are the misguided youth,
We sat back and lost our voices.

Delete rewind,
Try to change this state of mind,
Delete rewind,
And try to change this...

Because they're pushing us to the left,
In a world we shouldn't trust.
Delete rewind,
And try to change this state of mind.

I don't believe you knew it all, you knew it all along.

When will we stand up,
We've been through enough.
When will we stand up,
How'd we let them get the best of us?

When will we stand up,
We've been through enough.
When will we stand up,
How'd we let them take the best of us?





Another cold dark night, left alone
Your arrogance will lead to the death of you
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
So far from the truth you hide away
I'll be the one to pull your head back down
Remove your hollow crown
I'll die happy knowing that I will never be anything like you
What gives you the right to silence me?
All my life I've wanted just to feel like this
You came, you conquered you gave it away
And how does it feel staring down on your idol's grave
The one you once looked up to has fallen into dust
The one you once looked up to has fallen away
What's left for you in this fickle world?
Remove your crown


This is your country,
This is your home,
Here is the house where you grew up alone.

The city streets,
You used to love,
Are bruised and broken,
Are black and blue.
On our TV's, miles away.
On our doorsteps with no reason why.

Take it back, take it back, take it back.

This is your country,
This is your home,
Here is the house where you grew up alone.
Remember this for what it was.

Take it back, take it back, take it back.

You want a voice,
But your voices sound like violence.
Blegh!
You don't deserve this life.

This is your country,
This is your home,
Here is the house where you grew up alone.
Remember this for what it was,
a bleak projection of absent minds.

You want a voice,
But your voices sound like violence.
You shout so loud but all I hear is silence.
The city streets that you show no love,
Are bruised and broken,
Because of you.

This is your country,
This is your home,
Here is the house where you grew up alone.

Remember this for what it was.


Remember when hell had frozen over?
The cold still burns underneath my skin
The water is rising all around me
And there is nothing left I can give

All these tears I've shed
I saw the wildfire spread
You said you cheated death
But heaven was in my head

They say the good die young
No use in saying what is done is done
'Cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea
But it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like like a brand new doomsday
No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday

The embers still glow when I'm sober
The gold in the flame burns brighter now
I have to rebuild, now it's over
Maybe now I'm lost I can live

Souls don't break, they bend
But I sometimes forget
I have to do this for you
And the only way out is through

Death is an open door

Words the prophets said
Still swimming through my head
Now there's no stars left in the sky
'Cause this well will never run dry
What if I completely forget?
What if I never accept?
'Cause when you fade away
It's like a brand new doomsday

They say the good die young
No use in saying what is done is done
'Cause it's not enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
What will be will be
Every river flows into the sea
But it's never enough
And when the night gives way
It's like a brand new doomsday
No matter what they say
It's like a brand new doomsday


They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

They'll only sell us out once our backs are turned,
And we'll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt.
So cast your votes,
Watch them shed their skin.
Every snake has its price.
If the money's on the table they don't think twice.
So cast your votes, 
Watch them shed their skin.

We are paralysed.

But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck;
About what matters to us.

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette.
They'll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt.
So cast your votes, 
Watch them shed their skin.
Always out for blood, praying on the weak.
We can count on them to paint the future bleak.
But we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

We are paralysed.

But there are none so blind as those who will not see.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck;
About what matters to us.
So enough is enough.
What's it going to take to get us to stand up?
'Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don't give a fuck.

Right and wrong it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see.
They are leeches all (They are leeches all).

Right and wrong it's all the same to me.
Thick as thieves as far as I can see (I can see).
They are leeches all but we're still standing by whilst they bleed us dry.

They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.

We are paralysed.

They want all for one and none for all,
I want to be there to witness the downfall.


I've been out for so long, days slipped by again
And I can't sleep since I stopped caring
I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights anymore
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

This is so unfamiliar; death is no man's friend
Yet I'll stay here until I hear him roar

Death is screaming my name but I refuse to listen to him

I can't sit here forever
Watch me rise again
Watch me rise back up
Forever would be just be so easy to fall into
But still I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
Forever is the easy option but I won't take it

The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave


Your life is ending, one minute at a time,
check the clock and stand in line.
Hibernate, till your life's passed you by.
Please stop living like you're waiting to die.

Keep up, don't get left behind.
Don't slip up, chase that finish line.
They don't want you believing that your life deserves a meaning.

Weary soul's trying to forget,
that we're all puppets with a lifetime debt.

What a feeling, built to break.
Happiness with an expiry date.
Please stop living like you're waiting to die.

Stitched into our lives, drained until we expire.

Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line.
In this race we're all reduced to vermin.


After all is said and done
I'm left with reflections of your eyes haunting my mind
So dead inside, what good came out of this?
I was the one that tore you down
I'm down yet oh so guilty
Every last breath I have is yours to keep
This constant cloud is watching over me
I wish I had the time to make you see this through
We've been here too many times
I've felt like this too many times
Oh god, I am this I'm dead inside, looking out for you
And your final words I was the one that tore you down


The sick get sicker while the rich get richer.
Capital greed paired with vestigial superstition.
The sick get sicker while the rich get richer.
Angels and demons, money and munitions.

Your left wing clipped,
buy a gun for jesus.
Opportunities for all those willing to pay.

Out of sight, out of mind,
too afraid of the horror that you might find.
Out of sight, out of mind.
How much does your faith cost?

Celestial shepherd watches over his flock.
What about those black sheep that he forgot?
Unanswered faith is everything that they've got.
I'd like to think you're everything that I'm not.

Something here doesn't add up.

Your charity starts and ends at home.
Your conscience called but you hung up the phone.


Can I blame it on you?
I just can't win

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart
Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in?

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so tight

I just can't handle another day of this
I just can't win

Get me out alive

Oh God, I mean it
These are violent days for you and me
I just can't handle another day of this routine

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
I've found my excuse this time
Your words are wearing me down
A constant frown upon my back

Follow the water
Drain the lake and bring it back to me


There is no endgame.
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame.
Just put us out of our misery.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.
A failed evolution.
Is the problem, the solution,
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
'Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends,
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

A thorn in the side of the Earth,
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design.
The rest is history.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.

"We live in an infinite growth paradigm. Nothing grows forever, it's not possible. As a great, uh psychologist James Hillman wrote: "The only thing that grows in the human body after a certain age is Cancer." and I think that that's clearly what we're seeing at the end of human industrial civilization with the population approaching seven billion."

We're all guilty as sin.
I feel it, I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, 
Without lifting a finger, lifting a finger.

OH!

We may be infinite but this world is not.
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot, that we long forgot.

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
'Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends.
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

We're all guilty as sin.
I feel it, I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, 
Without lifting a finger, lifting a finger.

We may be infinite but this world is not something that we once knew that we long forgot.


The weight of the world is resting on thin ice.
When the surface breaks, will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect,
What a waste of time I was in retrospect.

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me. (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

Annihilate me!

Do you remember when you said to me: "My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison, blergh!

Of all the patterns that I could create, 
I built a labyrinth with no escape,
To keep my 'self' under lock and key;
I am my own worst enemy!

I'd take a leap of faith, but I'd lose my nerve.
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve.

I'm always gone with the wind.
Crawling in and out of my mind.
God knows I lost all my faith.

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me...

A sickness with no remedy;
Except the ones inside of me. (Inside of me)
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

If I could silence all the doubt in me;
Accept that what is meant to be, is meant to be.
You ever wonder how deep you can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me!

I remember when you said to me: "My friend, hope is a prison."


An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some!
Bitter and then some!

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow.
But we're still holding on, for dear life.

You sold us all down the river
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver
You said you'd change the world, but death still flies east
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we've seen this all before

We've given the vampires the keys to the blood bank
They say the more things change, the more they stay the same
Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it,
It beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?
You fucking parasite!

There's no room in here for an honest man, only callous and cold hearts!

Gravedigger, there's blood on your hands.
You built this empire on salt and sand.
Not all is fair in love and war.
History repeats we've seen it all before

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand.
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand...

An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vultue posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you've become!
You are the reason we are bitter and then some!
Bitter and then some!

They sing of saviours, we sing of sorrow.
But we're still holding on, for dear life.


This is a wake-up call.
No rise without the fall.
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can't hide.

You can run but you can't hide.

I met the Devil and God and couldn't tell them apart.
I thought I found the end but it was only the start.

I've heard it all before.
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go.
Gravity, hold on to me...

So come and wash us away,
Just thank fuck we don't last forever.
It's now or never.
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere.
Because it's gone and it's never coming back.

So make no mistake. It's just a matter of time before the wave breaks.
So stand your ground. The Earth will shake.
So twist the knife, 'cause I am finally awake.

So come and wash us away.
Just thank fuck we don't last forever.
It's now or never.
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere.
Because it's gone and it's never coming back.

I've heard it all before.
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
Just let go.
Well what are you waiting for?
Aren't you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
It's all you know
Gravity, hold on to me...

So stand your ground. The Earth will shake.
So twist the knife 'cause I am finally awake.


Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I'll take the mess you made
And I'll make it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still forever 

Ohhh

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

This moment that we're in
Is slow and disappointing
Time will never stand still forever
If you take this chance we've got
We can make it beautiful
If you'd take my word 
I'd be your saviour

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Yeah

Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I took the mess you made
And made it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still forever
Forever


How can you stand there and look me in the eye?
Tell me that you knew it was coming for us
I know that you said I was all you ever wanted
But you pushed me overboard
Into knee deep water
And you didn't throw the anchor of hope
You pushed me overboard
Without concern for what I was feeling inside
Heartless intentions
Your favourite game to play
I knew that I was never good enough to make you smile
Still you play these games, you ruin me from the inside
Tearing me down
I can't hide
I can't not act torn about this
What can I do to make you see?
How it affects me, so deeply still
I'm untouched from your point of view


There, there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings

So, so far from home
In need of your voice
To hold my head together

So, so far from home
In need of your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

You, you can but wait
for me to return
For me to show you how I felt

These months have just blurred
and the days just fly by
These times I needed to feel you
right by my side

So, so far from home
In need of your voice
To hold my head together

So, So far from home
In need of your voice
To lift my lonely state of mind

Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
Oh there must be
An easier way
To release these feelings

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong

As the sea breeze hits my lungs
It takes me back to where I belong
To where I belong


Hunt them down before it's too late
Now is the times to make the most of their pain
They deserve it for all that they have ruined for you
Don't think or say anything
Don't hold back, you'll regret this night
It's all over
Don't make the same mistake twice
Finish them now
Push them down
Face first to the ground
They deserve it for all they have done to you


For weeks I've felt lost and I can't see the light
Shining through the darkest of days
What can I do to stop myself from hiding my thoughts
From this world of lies?
I've felt so lost for far too long
Trying to leave it all behind
I find I cannot forgive myself for feeling like this
How can I even begin to forgive myself for all the things I'm thinking of doing to you?
How can I forgive myself for this?
But it's all in your head
You just walk out of my life and you expect me to let you back in
With open arms I'll turn to you
For weeks I've felt lost and I can't see the light
So I'll do this one alone
I'll hide my thoughts from you
Is it beyond impossible for me to hold on for you?
Is it beyond you to forgive me?
If not I'll do it on my own time
How can I forgive myself?
For my world is slowly falling down
And you just stand there and watch me fall


Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be,
These nights I feel so restless,
Tonight I feel useless.

Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be,
These nights I feel so restless,
Tonight i'm useless!

Blaming myself for every wrong move I should've thought this through,
Before I pulled you down with me,
Motionless I lay,
When your words could save me from this situation.

I've been lying here for what it seems like days,
And it was my mistake from the start.

Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be,
It was my mistake from the start.

Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be,
It was my mistake from the start.

Motionless I lay with no words to save me.
Staring blankly into concerned eyes.
I needed the right words to become commendable.
I needed the right words but I just can't find them, I just can't find them.
OH!

I'll spend years making you believe I was just a bad dream, just a bad dream.

And it was my mistake from the start.
I've been lying here for what seems like days.

Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be.
It was my mistake from the start.

Take your time to find me,
I can't promise where i'll be.
It was my mistake from the start.

I'm determined to find a way out.
To disconnect myself from you again.
How can I? How shall I? My one chance, all to you.
How can I feel like I shattered my...oh...tonight?

I'll spend years making you believe that I was only a bad dream.

I'm determined to find a way out.
To disconnect myself from you again.
How can I? How shall I? My one chance, all to you.
How can I feel like I shattered my, one chance tonight? 


We'll fight this cause even if it kills us
The temperature is rising but our lungs will not collapse
Here in the desert there's nothing to run from
Nothing to hide from
So let's rock the Casbah
Take it by the scruff of the neck 
And if you've got the time, Baby I've got the money 
And I'd give anything to see her smile again
And I'd do anything for one last smile
She had a love like nobody else
Unrivalled beauty, wanted them to love her back
And when they didn't, she shed a tear
A piece of us all died that day
We all died that day


Picked yourself up,
Stop loving, start living,
Don't get held back,
That's where they want you to be.

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they pushed us aside,
We got back up again,
Yeah we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

Pick yourself back up and learn to live,
Stop caring, stop thinking.
Picked yourself back up and learn to live,
The grass is greener on the other side, so don't give up on life.

Never back down, do this for yourself,
You don't need anyone to get you where you deserve.

I never paid much attention to them.

Every time they push us aside,
We jump back up again,
Yeah, we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

Every time they push us aside,
We jump back up again,
Yeah, we made it through the rain,
Just to live another day without them.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.
We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.
We are the ones you left out in the rain,
Come back tomorrow and we'll be here again.

Here again...

We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain just to live another day,
We made it through the rain, the rain.




It feels like someone is following my every footstep around every corner,
And there are times when I know I've felt someone else with me.

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.

I refuse to rest and I refuse to sleep until I have you in my sights.
It's gone too far. 
A few steps behind.
Where are you now?

What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?
What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?

How can you do this?
I'll never sleep until I find you.

I swear I've felt your presence once before,
Or has my paranoia gone far too far?

I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!
I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.
I'll never rest and I'll never sleep till I get my hands around your neck.
It's gone too far. A few steps behind. I'm coming for you now.

All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, 
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you.
All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat, 
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you there!


I can't see myself holding on for much longer
It's tearing me apart
I feel so out of place from the rest of you
All I needed was something
And that something was you
But you're so far away now
Can you hear me screaming?


As above. So below.
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease.
As within. So without.
The seasons bring relief. 
Let me live and die in peace.

(Let me live and die in peace, let me live and die in peace, let me live and die in peace, let me live and die in peace.)

I will be consumed, returned into the Earth.
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to.
Like the thaw against the snow into the undertow.
Cut the chord and cast me out.
And cast me out.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

As above. So below.
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left cannot decease.
As within. So without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

Change, and everything is change, nothing can be held onto. To the degree that you go with a stream, you see, you are still, you're flowing with it. But to the degree you resist the stream, then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you. So swim with it, go with it. And you're there. You're at rest.

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone.
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own.
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone.
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own.

When my heart skips two beats,
I am hidden deep fast asleep.
The sea will part where oceans meet,
Finally complete.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law...

Swansong.
A declaration of endlessness, I swear I will not look back.
As I return into the black, when the veil lifts,
How will I know? How will I know?
Will I see God?

As above. So below.
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left cannot decease.
As within. So without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

You can't hang onto yourself. 
You don't have to try not to hang onto yourself. 
It can't be done, and that is Salvation. 
Memento Mori; be mindful of Death.


Been searching all day for the answers 
Do you remember when life was so simple?
They were shooting at us after all this time
Shooting at us
Killing us all and we're all numb
Numb with the sound
Sound of our fears
We're all numb
And just before you die, take a look up to the sky and tell them it was all worth it


Say what you like, I know what I am
Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam
You said we'll never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference

Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

With every concession another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing, if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only he could let things get so dire
All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs

I know it haunts you, it haunts me too
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?

Naysayer
Naysayer, hammer the nail

We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire


We are beggars.
We are so fucking weak.
And once upon a time we had the world at our feet.
Well we're all dying to meet our maker,
But all our Gods have abandoned us!

All our Gods have abandoned us!

This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

We are all the shades of misery.
The reigning champions of tragedy.
They use their faith as a weapon, they count our sins by the seven.
Blackwater at the gates of heaven.

All hail the corporatocracy.
The word of God written in binary.
All hail our apostasy, 
The dying notes in an unholy symphony, blegh!

All our Gods have abandoned us!

This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

I found God clutching a razor blade. 
He said: "Look at the fucking mess they've made. 
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold."

We are beggars.
We are so fucking weak.

I found God clutching a razor blade.
He said: "Look at the fucking mess they've made. 
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold, 
But they're as worthless as the souls they sold."


I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home
It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through
And it tears me down
It makes me sick of being who I am, of who I cannot be
A constant reminder
I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home
It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through
Cold nights, again left alone
Wandering streets all on my own
And all of this for you
It's time that I went back for just even an hour
To talk to you to make things fine again
Again and again I will run from you


Every other question youll never find the answer to
They can hear us but we will never see them

Do you feel safe?
Do you even understand me?
Do you even understand me?

We make no difference when numbers count for nothing
We make no difference if choices have been made
When your path has already been walked
When your hourglass is fooling you

What can you rely on?
Time is our only friend, now

If my life was to end today, It wouldnt change the world in any way

This sudden realisation is tearing me apart
This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end?
What will happen when our time comes
Who will stand the final test of time?

This life is so perfect
What can be said of the end
Will we be resurrected?
Who will stand the final test?


The towers that shoulder your pride
The words you've written in stone
Sand will cover them, sand will cover you
The streets that suffer your name
Your very flesh and your bones
Sand will cover them, sand will cover you

So put your faith in more than steel
Don't store your treasures up, with moth and rust
Where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs from out your heel
We live in but a shadow of the real

Step out from time, see the dust of nations
Step out from time, hear the stars ovation

Saturn will not sleep, until the sand has made us clean
Still we stack our stones and bury what we can
But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun
Will ever stand before the endless march of sand


When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question cause and effect
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity
Striking with impunity

When corruption rears its ugly head
The force of law becomes a farce
Personal ambition usurps justice
The rich protected at the expense of the poor
Would you sit on the fence, take no chance?
As those batons fall, turn a blind eye

In an ideal world
There'd be no need for law
No need for police
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak

OFFICER DOWN
OFFICER DOWN
OFFICER DOWN

Can we really afford to be so selectively blind?
If we dig too deep what would we find?
At authority's heart beats a dollar sign
Under such a regime we're all doing time
Striking with impunity
Hiding behind flags of immunity
Striking with impunity

Never say, you weren't warned
When they come to drag you away
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
They clench the fist of ordained might
From which side of the barbed wire
Do you want to see your life pass by?

In an ideal world
There'd be no need for law
No need for police
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak

OFFICER DOWN
OFFICER DOWN
OFFICER DOWN


When reason dies behind closed doors
Face down in a cell in a pool of piss
It's time to fear what we should respect
It's time to question
Cause and effect

Who teaches the teachers?
Who makes laws for lawmakers?
When they read us our rights
What about human rights?

Never say, you weren't warned
When they come to drag you away
To silence the dissident hiding in us all
They clench the fist of ordained might
From which side of the barbed wire
Do you want to see your life pass by?

In an ideal world
There'd be no need for law
No need for police
But in a society so sick
So obsessed with blind greed
Someone has to protect
The old and the weak


I admire your perseverance!

Everytime my back is turned your falling closer into my world,
I've told you so many times you need to back down, need to back down.

I told you you need to walk away.
All the countless efforts I have made.
One day i'll get you back, I swear i'll get you back.

Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?
Will this ever end or will time stand still forever?

Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world.
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?

Everytime my back is turned you're falling closer to my world.
How can you sleep when you know what you're doing to me?

I told you you need to walk away
Fuck all the efforts that I have made.
I've got you right where I want you.

After all the years i've known you when did you decide to fuck this up?
After all the years i've known you when did you decide to try and fuck this up?

I still admire your perseverance!

How did you think you'd get away with this?!

And it's time to teach you a lesson that you're never gonna fucking forget!
You are never gonna forget, not any time soon!
You're never gonna forget me!
Brargh!


I close my eyes and take a deep breath,
try to find my place in this.
Digging teeth into the hand that feeds,
so inhuman, I'm surprised you bleed.

Cutting teeth, fading belief.
Flip the switch and drag me in.
When they've had their way,
I doubt I'll even dream.

Stray from the path and you're on your own.
Lightening strikes in the unknown.
The view from here, even the blind would see,
that none of us were ever free.

I'll be the lines in-between,
the ones that tell you what you want and need.

I am only rust on the machine,
amber corrosion.
The loudest truth you never heard,
a silent explosion.

Take my head from the clouds,
lift my feet from the ground,
Last note dies, they don't make a sound.


Contaminated.
Nothing is sacred.
Born and bred on pure hatred.
'Cause they haunt our streets with a phantom fear.
No one is safe, no one is welcome here.
No one is welcome here.

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere.
Hidden in plain sight,
Lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

They want the victims to hang their heads in shame, 
Well fuck them all, we won't play their game.
We won't play their game.
I've seen through every word the prophets propagate.
This is a failed state.
So read between the lines.
This is a failed state.

No Love. No empathy.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.
No Love. No Unity.
Erase our souls, distort reality.

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere.
Hidden in plain sight,
Lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

They will sow the seeds of blind contempt, 
Then let us bleed until our heart's content. 
Hidden in plain sight, 
Lost in black and white.
I'll chase the dying of the light.

No Love. No empathy.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.
No Love. No empathy.
No Love. No Unity.
Our fellow man is now our enemy.


I can't
Seem to get a hold of this
This mess
Seems to be taking
Its grasp on every
Everything that we once worked for
And I can't bear to watch
Everything just fall around me,

And I've been struggling for so long
So long
And I've been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

And when the red glazes over my eyes
There's nothing anyone can say or do
Just you try and stop me
Try and stop what I've have become how I wish there was a way.

And I've been struggling for so long
So long
And I've been
Looking for away
To make everything fall into place

Everything just fall into place
Every word I ever said
Is making sense again
When the red glazes over my eyes
There's nothing anyone can say or
Say or do

And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today I cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore
And still today cannot tell
The dream's from nightmares anymore

If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
If you reject the ones you love,
You'll find yourself cold and broken again
Stay Young Forever

You've done this to yourself or so, so it seems
You left behind everything
All your friends and all your family
Does it not feel slightly daunting
How you still sleep at night
When you must be able to hear them fight
It's all about you
All about you
All about the way you choose to live

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

How did it come to this

Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us

You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half

You made your choice now turn and get out
You made your choice now turn and get out

How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you 

How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

You left every one you loved
Crushed
Broken
Snapped straight in half


"The old appeals to racial, sexual, 
And religious chauvinism, 
And to rabid nationalist fervor are beginning not to work. 
A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth as a single organism, 
And recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. 
We are one planet."


Resist, rise against
Tuning out the message they sent
Waking up, things never felt so clear
All of it ceased, I want it to pass

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning

Cover up the mistakes that you made
You better believe this feeling won't fade
Digging deep, there's a long way to go
But there's some things that we want you to know
These pills must be bitter to swallow
What despair waits for us tomorrow?
This is only a matter of time
One day you're gonna pay for your crime

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning
Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming

I'll clinch my name, I'm fading now
But we're not ready just to lay down and die
The clouds are smoke signals, so you'll find your way
Spread the word of the mess that we're in
This is a chance to live through my end

I'm wide awake, but I still hear you

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning
Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming


The sun was so low that day
Staring into burning eyes
Watch as I walk away from you
From the lies that you made my life
Making me feel so lost and helpless
Running won't help me
Now it's too late
Closing my eyes to the skies makes it worse
Look down and I've been here for far too long
Too long to contemplate
The was so low that day
Staring into burning eyes
But it's far too late to contemplate leaving you alone against your will
Running won't help you now
Look down and try to forget me
Staring into your burning eyes
All that is left is the sound of your fragile voice
Echoing in my wondering mind
The sun was so low that day
I had to turn from your gaze
Only to reassure
Running won't help


[Instrumental]


I won't hold my hand out to anyone but you
I don't want to trust anyone but you
If I am to be saved my anybody I want it to be you
I take your hand
You'll find hope scribbled onto scrap pieces of paper
Like I found fate stuck to the curb
Save me now
I won't hold my hand out to anybody but you
There's still time to get hands around my fucking neck
It's time to realise that there is far more to this world that the self loathing you endure
You'll find hope scribbled on scrap paper


Hey!
There's no price to hide,
When you're high on the white lie.
So lost,
I've beat death. (White!)
Kill us. (Lie!)
Don't tell us.

The devil that you know,
Knows no...no death is too low.
Right when they want you.
To, to get lost, to be strong.
Save us from the cure.

With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands.
The chemical miracle, the one you've been praying for.
With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands.
Our condition is critical but we keep coming back for more.

There's no price to hide,
When you're high on the white lie.

Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Hanging by a thread!
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh
Ready to drop dead!

With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands.
The chemical miracle, the one you've been praying for.
With our heads in the sand we've left our lives in their hands.
Our condition is critical but we keep coming back for more.

Save us!
Save us!
From the cure!


You've done this to yourself or so, so it seems
You left behind everything
All your friends and all your family
Does it not feel slightly daunting
How you still sleep at night
When you must be able to hear them fight
It's all about you
All about you
All about the way you choose to live

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

How did it come to this

Is there any point to this, are you even listening to us

You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half
You still left everyone you loved
Crushed, broken, snapped straight in half

You made your choice now turn and get out
You made your choice now turn and get out

How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you
How do you sleep at night
It's all about you, it's all about you

You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough
You still put smoke in your lungs, despite not giving enough

You left every one you loved
Crushed
Broken
Snapped straight in half


When time resets, we all become zero.
Decimals apart, take us back to the start.
Tear down the walls, that were built to divide.
Can you feel that fire growing?

We're standing on the edge of the event horizon,
moments before the earth starts to flatline.


Never, never lose sight
Of what you started it for
No matter what comes in between

And I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you're the reason I'm wanting to stay

I used to sink and now I swim
I've had to work for everything

When will you recognize your it, you're the reason I feel so alive
And none else comes in between

I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And you're the reason I'm wanting to stay

I can't turn my back and leave you
After all you've done for me
I can't turn my back and leave you
After all you've done for me

The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can't make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me
I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I can't make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me

Oh how I wish it was you instead

I never knew I could feel like this

The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead


It's getting hard to breathe in here
What I would give to be set free
This darkness surrounds me
They're coming for us
Take careful aim
I know you won't miss
Avoid eye contact
Shoot the messenger
Pools of blood surround
Don't run and hide this time
But we've made a mistake
A glaring error
We're adrift
Nearly gone
And if you knew you'd get away with it all, what would you do?
In my darkened tomb, I am laid to waste


Hey, hey
They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey
They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

This is where tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.
You know they're here when the water is red.
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread.

A message etched on broken ships.

Hey, hey
They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey
They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

And you can hear them cry, they're calling out,
To their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
She's bleeding out.

Their innocence is heaven sent.
Their malevolence, it will not relent.
A graveyard sits upon the shore.
They won't swim together anymore.

The tide will rush with waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
The tide will rush in waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
The devil is near.

"If we're gonna survive on this planet, we have to
Respect the rights of all those species to survive.
'Cause we need them more than they need us."

A message etched on broken ships.
We'll be here til corruption quits.
There is a voice, though they cannot speak.
Not yet ready to admit defeat.

You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
To their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
To their mother lost, she's bleeding out.

Their tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.


That distant blue, that's me and you
It was from there that we all grew
Framed in space, our first home
All those beating hearts that were made of stone
We were disaster built from flesh and bone

Their bodies made a mountain, a ladder to the stars
When they reached up to the sun, it only left them with scars
All the saints and the sinners will reap what they sow
So they stood back and watched their bitterness grow

They couldn't tell the cure from disease
They no longer knew their want from their need
They fucked the future, forgot the past
Nothing built was built to last

A common ground, now we see
That connected us like the land and the sea

That distant blue, that's me and you
It was from there that we all grew
Framed in space, our first home
All those beating hearts that were made of stone
We were disaster built from flesh and bone

Caught in a web, don't struggle free
This is all we've got, so just let it be
If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small
We'll ask ourselves why we cared at all

Caught in a web, don't struggle free
This is all we've got, so just let it be
If we save ourselves, we'll feel so small
Ask ourselves why we cared at all
Why we cared at all


Every moment is dead to me.

Do you remember? Because I can't forget.
The saddest story, of all that ever was, or will be.
Laid out before me. A living heart attack.
Play it back, play it back.

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense.
Past and future tense. Every moment is dead to me.
Safe and sound, anywhere but here.
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me.

It means nothing to me. 

Have you seen a future, filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten. Start over again.
You want to run away. Just let yourself decay.
A living heart attack. Play it back, play it back.

The empty hourglass. We're going nowhere fast.
There's no more time to kill, if time is standing still.

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense.
Past and future tense. Every moment is dead to me.
Safe and sound, anywhere but here.
I see it crystal clear, but it means nothing to me.

It means nothing to me. 

Play it back, play it back.
Over and over again, over and over again.

The empty hourglass. We're going nowhere fast.
There's no more time to kill, if time is standing still.


Fuck
Happiness or a broken bottle
This is all that we'll want to see tomorrow
You'll never know, what comes next
Still we'll never trust
Hands around our necks
Around our necks

Cross your fingers and hope for the best
Count the lights on the wall, try to get some rest

Everyone feels like they carry a curse
If we lose control, we won't be the first

The road is lost and you start to slip
When you hit the edge, the scales chip
The world might turn, upside down
The night my passion finds another town

We count on lucky stars, one day they'll open up
We live day by day in a shadow of doubt
While the motion slows, as we collide
While I see my life
Flash before my eyes

You'll never know, what comes next
Still we'll never trust
Hands around our necks


These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe
And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
Fourth drive in paradise
Vapid souls check the market price
Life time slave
Living in a suburban grave
If there was a God, was a God,
You would be the death of him

These colours don't run,
Like colours from the face,
Eyes roll back chemical despair,
It's true what they say life isn't fair

So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine
So repeat this line, everything, everything is fine

These colours don't run,
Like colours from the face,
Eyes roll back chemical despair,
It's true what they say life isn't fair

And in the land of the free
You know nothing comes for free
I'm struggling to find any poetry in this
Someone beat me to the line ignorance is bliss
So I guess I'll just say it how it is
You had it all, you fucking pigs!

These streets aren't paved with gold
Don't believe everything that you're told
Deception hides in all you see
Corruption hangs in the air that you breathe


Raid all the liquour stores
Kidnap the kids
This night's not over yet
Running on Lucifer's blood
We're trashed in the back of your car
A cheap lay in the parking lot
A shot for afters
As I watched you slaying behind the wheel
They're gaining on us
A sharp turn left
Running out of time
They're gaining on us
The lights flashed by as we sped towards our escape
Nothing else mattered
Nobody else cared
They'll be hanging us tonight
This was our masterpiece


I'll close my eyes and hold you in my arms despite all the pain
Your confession means nothing


When in Troy do as the Greeks do
This is treacherous
This is cold-hearted betrayal
Move in for the kill and you're all traitors
We'll fight them to the death!
Burn down the houses
Loot all the churches and we found the time to pray
Pray that our justice be done
Pray by the light of the moon that we're not here


Raging waters flood the valleys of your mind.
The torrent washed away the warning signs.
Swim through the one's and zero's,
So hard to tell the villains from heroes.
What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?

Washed up, face down on the digital shore.
Lungs contract, now dive back in for more.
Are you sitting on the edge of your seat?
"We'll be right back, don't move an inch"

Swim through the one's and zero's,
So hard to tell the villains from heroes.
Static mirror, life isn't black and white.
I understand it's hard to chose what's right.
Whiteout swallows us all.
Once snow-blind, we won't care at all.
What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?

Tunnel vision, hearts beat in time.
Rhythmic contractions drowning in a flood of distractions.

I want to wake up and find a world in remission,
Free from the grasp of the human condition.
But we're all trapped inside static screens,
Trained from birth just to nod and agree.
I don't want to believe, that we'll be forever, fast asleep.

Swim through the one's and zero's,
So hard to tell the villains from heroes.
Static mirror, life isn't black and white.
I understand it's hard to chose what's right.
Whiteout swallows us all.
Once snow-blind, we won't care at all.

What if they say isn't true?
What if they want isn't best for you?


Our story began in the heart of a star. 
We've lost our way, forgotten what we are. 
We are only particles in motion. 
Floating through space, a destructive race.
What a destructive race.

Look at this life as a grain of sand,
The blink of an eye, a world in your hands. 
Look at this life as a grain of sand,
The blink of an eye.

We're all thinking, feeling, surviving, believing 
In what we think is right, refract distorted light. 
You helped build this fire inside of me. 
Breathing fire won't burn down the borders, 
Set against everything that came before us. 
All those things that you despise, 
We all see through human eyes. 

Thinking, feeling, surviving, believing 
In what we think is right, refract distorted light. 
You helped build this fire inside of me. 
Breathing fire won't burn down the borders, 
Set against everything that came before us.
There is no side for us to choose;
Bound together, we all win or all lose. 

Look at this life as a grain of sand, 
The blink of an eye, a world in your hands. 

Life is so short, take a moment to feel alive. 
I know all we meant was to expand and to thrive. 
But we sharpened our claws and we went to war. 
With ourselves, with each other, with the rich and with the poor. 
With anyone different, who believes in less or more. 
Step out of the shadow, cast by left and right wings. 
Take refuge in each other and the triumph that it brings. 
Since we stood on two feet, we've been worth so much more. 
Now tear down the walls, that were built to divide, 
It's time to extinguish that fire inside.


The long walk home,
back to a no name town.
Where people pass me by
in red and white lines.
Your only son can't make you proud.
The moon and stars, this frozen clock.

And if in years to come we can talk like friends,
can I close my eyes and wake up then?

Drown out the sound of adulthood
with songs that fell from out of space.
At seventeen I wouldn't dare to dream
because hope's a dangerous thing.

I won't thank god, I'll thank my friends,
for sticking by till we're home again.
What matters most to me belongs to you.
Hope's a dangerous thing.

I pinch myself to see,
that if this curtain drops, this isn't me.
Pack my bags, no time to waste.
We leave no trace of us.
Still my pillow rings.


Believe in yourself
Believe in each other
Believe that we're nothing more
Than sisters and brothers
Believe that together
We can change for the best
Believe that these words are more than wasted breath
Are more than wasted breath


Love as you want to be loved
And live the way that you know you should
Keep the good ones by your side
You never know when they might fly up and away

Forever in mind, my mind
I'll be by your, your side
Forever in my mind, you'll be there


I' am your hero
Still i sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me
For getting everything right
I' am the sun
Still i sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Were all alone

In time you'll find that
Were all on our own (all on our own)
Were all on our own , chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen , im wearing thin
I need something to fill this void im constantly in
And I can't do this

I'm your hero
I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me
I got everything right
I' am the sun
I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

And i just dont care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

Im your hero
Save your thankyou's

In times to come ill rise above this
But for now I can't ill just sit here
My dreams have fallen once again
My dreams have fallen once again

I need something to fill this void im



I'm astounded I'm looking for a reason to leave
I'm astounded I'm looking for a reason to leave
The years I've put into everything I have
Everything I am

I'm needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I'll keep looking

It's time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
It's time to realise that my head
Is trying to push
Trying to push me out

I'm screaming out for help
Months
Years
Nobody hears
I'm screaming out, I'm screaming out
It's time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
I'm screaming out to no-one

I'm astounded still looking for a reason to leave
I'm astounded still looking for a reason to leave

The years I've put into everything I have now
The years that I've put into I am now

I'm needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But I'll keep looking

It's time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
It's time to take a step back
Look at my life and find
A stable place to hide
It's time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
Stable place to hide

Live everyday like your last
And take nothing for granted
I'll live everyday like my last
And I'll take none of this for granted 

Love as you want to be loved
And live the way that you know you should
Keep the good ones by your side
You never know when they might fly up and away

Forever in mind, my mind
I'll be by your, your side
Forever in my mind, you'll be there


I will spill blood on your filthy princess whites
Come home tonight so I can slit your throat
Every time you discard my heart
Your ship's sinking fast
The colours are fading
Save me again tonight
You know I'll make it count
Princess, there's more to life than robbing banks
You won't walk away from this broken heart
Slash my arms
Tear off my limbs
I will never back down to your sin


Find comfort in yourself
Begin to believe, before it's over
Lift your head up
Everybody's talking
Prove them wrong
Before your time is up
You keep it all in, and you never find a release
Take comfort in yourself
And only know how to find safety in yourself
Find your faith and find your hope
You'll find safety
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down on you
It's hard, but you can make it
Begin to believe
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down


The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.
The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.

If we stop the clock, will I reappear?
Pulled from the drift, there goes another year.
The stars align, the planets shift.
All the infinite moments that we've missed.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.
We all remember youth like it's dead and gone.
Like our favorite line from a forgotten song.

I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart.
A life lost in the dark.

The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.
The past is dead.
I walk the funeral march and I will make my peace.

When I reach the end, will I beg for more?
Will I look back, or step through the door?
I stand beneath a monolith.
Do you ever feel like you won't be missed?

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.
I heard that this was only a ride.
So there's no worth in waiting for death to arrive.

All we are, is just a name, it's all we are.
Our skin, it shows, these crippled bones.
Youth sinks alone.

All we are, is just a name, it's who we are.
Our skin, it shows, these crippled bones.
Youth sinks alone.

I'll show you my hurt and I'll show you my heart.
A life lost in the dark.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.
At least we're all lost together.

There's parts of me that are lost forever.


Well the times are so a'changing
Baby even when it's live
You can press pause and rewind

You knew it would go amazing
But is this what you had in mind?
Oh there's nothing you can't find

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah)

On the back of a transmitter
There's a little shiny fruit
And it's coming after you

As for Instagram and Twitter
She got caught in both lassoes
And neither one will cut her loose

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
(Yeah) Yeah

So baby take a walk with me
Past flying cars and time machines
There's magic like you won't believe, no

It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy
It's two thousand and thirteen
All across the galaxy


I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
What did you expect?
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile!


Well, I wrote my number down. 
I'd never wrote it down before. 
I was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
I didn't have the bottle at all. 

Well I had a look and you kept staring. 
Your head pairing up with mine 
Cos your so pretty and I'm so shy. 
You proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
Well I went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
And I felt regret. 
But in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
Cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

And when i did I couldn't see your face 
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
I dashed around to find you 
But you were nowhere to be seen 
Oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na nooooo 

Well yeah she flew away. 
She seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

Yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
Your so pretty and i'm so shy 


Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

And over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong, oh there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell em if you like
We'll tell em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

I said no
Oh no
Oh you won't get me to go
Anywhere, said anywhere
I won't go
Oh no no

Well over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But I just cannot get angry in the same way
Not in the same way
Not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no


In the tunnel, I noticed I had a choice of three. While I thought it very kind of them to offer me this, I do wonder if they realise what a dilemma they were sending to face me. The trouble was if I looked at your reflection in the left window I missed the actual image of you and your reflection in the right. And if I looked at the right I had the same problem but the other way around. At first I thought I should probably settle on one of the mirrors as they were soon to disappear, but that idea quickly wilted and my attention was drawn back to the center, occasionally checking on either side. I must say I did question the authenticity of your nap a few minutes before. As the train left Loughborough I suspected it could have been a device to avoid conversation. I'd barely considered this for a moment, however, when a heavy breath and a gulping sound that I decided would be too embarrassing to fake led me to conclude that your nap wasn't fraudulent. I found it difficult to concentrate on anything else as you slumped beneath your coat. Delighted that we'd waited until this hour to travel so the evening sun got its opportunity to skip across those sleeping cheeks, but unnerved by the prospect of being removed from the opposing chair to yours. I knew it was reserved, but hoped that whoever had reserved it had fallen over. It looked as if today I'd be safe; the train wasn't too busy, but I did take a moment to recall a time when I was less fortunate. I remembered it with a chilling vividity we were on the way to Brighton. I knew it was going to be his seat as soon as I saw him on the platform unzipping, checking, zipping, and re-checking things. Something about his face suggested that he had for years had a moustache and had not long since removed it. He wasn't going to think twice about disposing of me, especially considering then he'd get the chance to sit with you.


Caricatures of your wrecking ball 
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lining up 
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
Hiding has changed its tune 
Linking arms, syncing hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves


So when you gaze at planet earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many lovers
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on "Parliament Brawl"
Emergency battery pack just in time
For my weekly chat with God on video call

Breaking news, they take the truth and make it and fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of "you don't know what you're doing"

And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many lovers

And all of my most muscular regrets explode
Behind my eyes like American sports

And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many lovers


Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a helter skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a seventies head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like'

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure


Baby, I'm yours
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky,
Yours until the rivers all run dry
In other words, until I die

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until the sun no longer shines,
Yours (yours) until the poets run out of rhyme
In other words, until the end of time

I'm gonna stay right here by your side,
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothin' in the world can drive me away
Cause every day, you'll hear me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours) until two and two is three,
Yours (yours) until the mountain crumbles to the sea
In other words, until eternity

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Till the stars fall from the sky
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Till the rivers all run dry
Baby, I'm yours

Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours


When you left the house this evening, 
You said you'd be back in a little while
Well I've been waiting for such a long time, 
And this wait is driving me wild...

And while I wait I think about you,
Do you need me when I'm not there?
Are you planning to be without me?
Do you have a new attract?

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman 

If he is on you...
It keeps flashing through my mind, 
If you would only call, 
If you would be so kind. 
Imagine things, 
I see another man
And it's this waiting I just can't stand...

You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman 
You're a bad bad woman
You're a bad bad woman


Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
With the ending wreak of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone

Oh, will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you wish you'd never been born
You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
But we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
She can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
How the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks is this...
Crime!

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight

You'll be able to post any day of the most
For the sights of all time

You knew that he'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming, but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart Abba Drava
Keep on the balaclava


I want an interesting synonym
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine (we've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss
Over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams
It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called "Integrity"
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time
That I got sucked into a hole through a hand held device?
I will flashback now and again but I'm usually alright
Thankfully the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection
Opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognized the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection
Opening credits roll
Killer pink flamingos
Computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul


There's always somebody taller 
With more of a wit 
An easy quipp to enthrall her
And her friends think he's fit 
And you just can't measure up no 
You don't have a prayer 
Wishing you had made the most of her 
When she was there 
They've got engaged 
No intention of a wedding 
He's pinched your bird 
And he'd probably kick your head in 

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts 
You're better off without her anyway 
You said you wasn't sad to see her go 
Yeah but I know you were though

He might be one of those boys 
That's all pretty and vain 
Likes to go in the sunbed 
And stays out of the rain 
So that he don't get his hair wet 
You wouldn't want that 
At least he hasn't got a Nova 
Or a Burberry hat 

They've got engaged 
No intention of a wedding 
He's pinched your bird 
And he'd probably kick your head in 

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts 
You're better off without her anyway 
You said you wasn't sad to see her go 
Of course you were 

Have you heard what she's been doing? 
Never did it for me 
He picks her up at the school gates 
At twenty past three 
She's been with all the boys 
But never went very far 
She wagged English and Science 
Just to go in his car 

They've got engaged 
No intention of a wedding 
He's pinched my bird 
And he'd probably kick my head in, oh 
Now the girls have grown 
But I'm sure they still carry on in similar ways 

Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts 
So I'm better off without her anyway 
I said I wasn't sad to see her go 
But I'm only pretending, you know 
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know 
Yeah, I'm only pretending, you know 
Oh I'm only pretending, you know


He spoke a script
dipped in the sort
and taught a major ?????

It's all a trick,
the slicks back slimey arms have got a water wage
He's got a laugh like a crackling wire
and he wants to put the bite marks on you,
he wants to put the bite marks on you

And you twist my guts
As the only thing that's worth having that as invitations
are his excuses and he said
I am the conductor, put me in the terror pocket

He's in a splint
master in a crafty squint ????? respectable.
Drop a dirty hint if he thinks that he couldn't press you would be unacceptable.

And he has searched through all the pages with his fingers
and covered them with goooooo!
And he wants to put the bite marks on you,
he wants to put them on you and it hurts my back!
thats the only thing that took ?? adoration
is the danger that it lies on its own
and the spill ??????????????????????
and it frightened me to death when he said
I am the conductor, put me in the terror pocket

Cos' ?????? to give me a ticket to a competition!
and i don't know how the odds are stacked
as he's rolling out the running track.


Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings in the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabaret
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just in case

And now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Is it true you win when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
Do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

And now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away a laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle


Brian
Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful, so strangely comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator

Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours

She'll be saying, use me
Show me the jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there, on a plate
You're whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire the eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
Hup

Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their

Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator


I want to build you up (brick by brick)
I want to break you down (brick by brick)
I'm going to reconstruct (brick by brick)
I want to feel you love

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)

I want to steal your soul (brick by brick)
I want to rock 'n' roll (brick by brick)
I want to rock and roll (brick by brick)
I want to rock and roll

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)

I want a brick by brick (brick by brick)
I wanna blow wide berth (brick by brick)
I wanna melt this soul (brick by brick)
I wanna brick by brick, by brick, by

Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)
Brick by brick (ah)


Both sides, in softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist, just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks, and with his index finger flicks you on your socks

I go high pitched, he'll talk and make your voice sound high pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own, and whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone, his heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw, its impossible not to feel inferior.

And he could catapult you back to your daddy or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph feels as hollow after the day of tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape 
And he's leaving without saying bye

And you will queue up to listen to him pissin
And hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they chase him down the avenue incessantly pestering him to let 'em join the club
He knows how to put a cork in the fuss and just how to shut up, the charming ones of us 
And I've seen him, talking to your lady friend 

There's a dust track waiting for betrayal 
Where he'll teach you all the bits they've missed

Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
Nice try, you cannot turn away but nice try
You cannot turn away


My baby wants to drive the train 
But don't you let her, don't you let her touch the tracks 
I said my baby wants to drive the train 
Well all aboard yeah, and don't forget to mind the gap 
Don't you let her, don't you know 
She's sick and tired of 
Being in the background, the passenger 
Let her drive the train, oh! 

Choo Choo! 
Why don't you let her drive the train? 
Choo Choo! 
Why don't you let her drive the train, yeah

Make your way down, we'll shut the door bout quarter to five 
I said she's setting off from platform four 
And they've decided that they're gonna let her drive 

Don't you let her, don't you know 
She's sick and tired of 
Being in the background, the passenger 
Let her drive the train, oh! 

Choo Choo!

Get out the way, mister 
With your short sharp tips 
No, I won't read your lips right now 
And baby, hey 
You send a shiver down my spine 
But do you read my mind 
Do you... 
And you're looking pretty suspicious 
And probably planning a heist 
He's wanting to go to the strippers 
It makes him feel all nice 

(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Smacking a bloke yeah) 
Smacking a bloke here tonight 

Get out the way, mister 
With your short sharp tips 
No, I won't read your lips right now 
And baby, hey 
You send a shiver down my spine 
But do you read my mind 
Do you... 

He's prob'ly got stopped by a panda 
For speeding on his way there 
... flashing of digital cameras 
From tourists in trafalgar square 

(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Snortin' some coke yeah) 
Snortin' some coke off her thighs 
Bla-bla-bla-bla-bla-bla... 

(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Smacking a bloke yeah) 
Smacking a bloke here tonight 
And I just can't see for the 
(Cigarette smoke yeah) 
The cigarette smoke in your eyes 
Watching a stripper and 
(Snortin' some coke yeah) 
Snortin' some coke off her thighs 
Lalalalalala laaaaaaaoooo 
Oww


Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues, the dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches but she's actually alright

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

A country home, even if we really tried
Would it cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back d'ya know?

Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well, spoken girls and stilettos
Aren't something to fear

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, I'm sorry
But we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you outta maybe not have anymore

Cigarette smoker, cigarette smoke doesn't hide
As well as you think
And you think that it outta act as the perfect disguise

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah


I thought I saw you in the battleship
But it was only a look a like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in the rusty hook
Huddled up in wicker chair
I wandered up for a closer look
And kissed who ever was sitting there

She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely, please
Can I call you her name

And I elongated my lift home,
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the parrots beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm

It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in letraset
No you can't call me her name

Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way 'round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I saw your sister in the cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand

She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,
You can call me anything you want


Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said your mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never look like yourself from the side
But your profile did not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puff your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning
Crying lightning

Your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying


I said I wanted it long but you cut it short
And now I'm catching a cold
I told you not but no crack in the doobie
But it was already rolled

Oh, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh well, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad

Well, I don't care about your massage oils
It's got my skin going red
Cause I'm a mad mother-fucker
With my curtains open
Sitting tucked up in bed

I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh well, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad

I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh well, I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed
Oh yeah, well I turned down my lights
And my curtains weren't closed last night
Oh baby, I must be mad


He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for desperately trying to simulate what it was that was all right
Three quarters of an hour ago
That led him to be in a position
And every copper mission
On every other episode

He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink, but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know you're his favorite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
And try and keep your trousers on

You should know you're his favorite worst nightmare


007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting there 'selves because there's another name coming to claim
what is his to claim
10% faster with a sturdier frame

He's certainly come into his own, 
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two things you'll never
Be my darling

Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion it must be good
Oh wouldn't the penny would drop with an incredible thud
They forgot to kick the tin, he knows where she's going 
But don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the 'other thing'
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in


They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last are two 
Things you'll never be my darling 

Things you'll never be my darling

(Two things you will never be my darling)

(Two things you'll never be my darling)


They sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up lines
Not to feel like a twat at times is hard
(But not for this kid, not when they come to you.)



I heard the truth was built to bend 
A mechanism to suspend the guilt 
Is what you are requiring still 
You've got to dance little liar 

Just like those fibbs that pop and fizz 
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
And you're bound to trip 
And she'll detect the fiction on 
Your lips and dig a contradiction up 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt beneath the dirt 
The liar take a lot less time 

I'm sure it's clear and plain to me 
Its not an alibi you need just yet 
Oh no it's something for those beads of sweat 
Yes that we'll get you back to normal 

And after you have dabbed the patch you'll grieve 
And then proceed to scratch the varnish off 
That newly added calmness 
So as not to raise any alarms too soon 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt beneath the dirt 

The liar takes a lot less 

Time to decide on his saunter 
Have you got itchy bones 
And in all your time alone 
Can you hack your mind being riddled 
With the wrong memories 

And the clean coming will hurt 
And you can never get it spotless 
When there's dirt between the dirt


Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Don't you always do the same
It's what you there for, don't you know

The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best ...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for
Well don't you always do the same
It's what you're there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting


Been fighting with my sheets
And nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well taught gripe
The most restraining type
You should have racing stripes

The way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot
And you press it to my chest and you make me wheeze
Then to my knees you do promote me

I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I won't be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

The light it fidgets through
The thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance
The first and final chance
And cause the audience

The frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam
She broke everyone's hearts

I'm pinned down by the dark
A-N-I-M-A-L
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess lioness

Pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark

D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L
D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S
A-N-I-M-A-L


he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do
although it might say a lot about the city or town, i don't care what they've got keep on turning them down
it don't say the funny things she does, don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen

he's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane
there might be tellys on the back of the seats in front but rodney and del won't do..
although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains 
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
cos she isn't there to hold your hand, she won't be waiting for you when you land

it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

yesterday i saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with, and almost shouted
and then reality kicked in within us it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summit, and half wonder if you won it at all

and don't say owt cos you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill

despair in the departure lounge, it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery
what's happened to me
*cough*


Diamonds are forever,
They are all I need to please me,
They can stimulate and tease me,
They won't leave in the night,
I've no fear that they might desert me.
Diamonds are forever,
Hold one up and then caress it,
Touch it, stroke it and undress it,
I can see every part,
Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.

I don't need love,
For what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me,
For when love's gone,
They'll luster on.

Diamonds are forever,
Sparkling round my little finger.
Unlike men, the diamonds linger;
Men are mere mortals who
Are not worth going to your grave for.

I don't need love,
For what good will love do me?
Diamonds never lie to me,
For when love's gone,
They'll luster on.

Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.
Forever and ever


Have you got color in your cheeks'
Do you ever get the feeling that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like something's in your teeth
And some aces up your sleeve
I had no idea that you're in deep
I dreamt about you near me every night this week
How many secrets can you keep'
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
When I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you.

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together, if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (calling when you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you, (do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying
things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling darling?
(Do I wanna know)
Do you want me crawling back to you?


Well, the morning was complete
Where there was tears on the steering wheel, dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

It's the beginning of the end 
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that
It's these times that it tends
To start to breaking up, to start to fall apart
Hold on to your heart

And do me a favor, will you break my nose
And do me a favor, and tell me to go away
Oh, do me a favor, stop asking questions

Well she walked away while her shoes were untied 
When the eyes were all red
You could see that we'd cried 
And I watched, and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye

Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

And do me a favor, and ask, if you need some help
She said, do me a favor, and stop flattering yourself
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind
Perhaps 'fuck off' might be too kind


In the painted faces congregate
In the mating season
The seconds homes
They go alone
In no rush leave 'em
And there's a fountain
And a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And cuts you down to size

The people there
And the furniture
Start to seem important
A moment more
And you catch the floor
With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
Like the scimitar
Shaped yellow light
That picks you up
And cuts you down to size

Oh I had questions for the tap dancer
Sat on my lap
And she had child proof caps on her answers
Stone blower blow me a stone
And show me that handsome enchancer
She had a rock on her throttle
And a brown glass bottle full of
Shavings from the sun
Although those shoes affect your step
Don't forget whose legs you're on

There's a fountain and a scimitar
Shaped yellow light
And it picks you up
And it cuts you down to size


Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip and fryer fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Find a well-known hard man
And start a fight
Weigh your chances on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah

Bite the lightning
But tell me how it tastes
Kung-fu fighting
On your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh


Darlin' tell me something I don't know
Be my baby, be my GTO
Call me something no one else calls me
I forget how I want it
That electricity 
My heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn't see you sneak in but I'm glad you stopped
Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity
Love like locked horns
Love like dominos
Be my midnight
Be my ebb and flow
I forget how I want it
How it crept up on me
It takes over
Electricity
And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
Didn't see you sneak in but I'm glad you stopped
Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity
Separated
There I face it
Love like thunder
Love like falling snow
Tell me something I don't already know
Like how you get your kisses to fill me with electricity


You've never met before
But still she greets you like a long lost rock and roll
She's definitely one of those
Where you go wherever she goes

Oh my body and my mind
Both start talking at the exact same time
Try'na think of ways to make her mine
But they're difficult to find

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

And she said: 'Oh, well I knew this will sound cold
But I really have to go
Oh it's not that I'm not free
There's nowhere I need to be
It's just your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me'

It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

She said: I baby I can never leave you
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck
No point sticking to the plan when it's going slow

It's more a hunger than a thirst
You'll break it out the second time
Before you know about the first
Looks well-equipped to leave you in the lurch
But you'll let her do her worst

And it's not hard to tell
It's obvious the other angels faces fell
When she told them that she had to go
Traded her wings and overcoat for something colorful

(Tha knows)


Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you
I don't want to hear your

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
Oh she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band were fucking wank
And I'm not having a nice time"

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear, you know
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Yeah but his bird said it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
Yeah I'm sure it's pretty far

And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook


It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound
Silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
When I realise I'm just holding onto
The hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
Then I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

The seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
Because I decided long ago
But that's the way it seems to go when trying
So hard to get to something real
It feels . . .

It feels like I only go backwards, darling
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, no no, not if it
Feels like we only go backwards, darling


You showed me my tomorrow 
Beside a box of matches 
A welcome threatening stir 

My hopes of being stolen 
Might just ring true 
Depends who you prefer 

But if it's true you're gonna run away 
Tell me where 
I'll meet you there 

Am I snapping the excitement 
If I pack away the laugther 
And tell you how it feels 

And does burden come to meet ya 
If I've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel 

The day after you stole my heart, 
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you 

With you 

And now you're hiding in my sleep
And the book reveals your face 
And there's a splashing in my eyelids 
As the concentration continually breaks 

I did request the mark you cast 
Didn't heal as fast 
I hear your voice in silences 
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud? 

And the jostling crowd 
You're not allowed to tell the truth 
And the photo booth's a liar 

And the sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to inquire 
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes 
With things they never see if it smacked them in their temples


I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside


You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking a Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

Oh, that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now, when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said, she wasn't going, but she went, still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a mega-dobber or a betting pencil?

Oh, that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory, and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Whoa

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Started all the naughty nights with niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Everything was pretty in the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?


Advertise in imaginative ways
Start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike
It is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night
Dressed up in silver and white
With coloured old grey whistle test lights

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof
It was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

I'm Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind's eye
Okey cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget
Doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice
I don't want to be nice
And you know that

Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep popping up
Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
The information action ratio
Is the place to go
And you will not recognize
The old headquarters

All the nights that never happened
And the days that don't exist
At the information action ratio
Only time that we stop laughing
Is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
The information action ratio
(The information action ratio) is the place to go
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Now, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon
(The information action ratio)
It got rave reviews
Four stars out of five

Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while

Come and stay with us

You thrive on dancing in our laps
Before the more familiar chaps
And oh the curtain leads to fever

We watched a womaniser cry
And in the last sip you and I
Declared we might require a breather

I am the truth true through and I
Can feign excitement fluently
As solid as I can busk shock

With well presented merriment
And I know all too well
I shouldn't break the key off in the lock

And the tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast

The days drag their heels when you're not there to crack the whip
And the weeks wait to burst like a sache of brass

The old pantomime villian follows my coat
And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slots

And meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing

Drowned bags of sugar in the night
Rocketing shuttered doors despite
The shop not opening for hours

You can itch, flap, and whistle
And try to avoid the talk
As I scribbled over drivel you were snoring, showing off

The tumble splits the frame, revealing silk and fit
In the fright lined dining room
Throw a gaze towards them while they feast


Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary one
His way or no way, he totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don't want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain, you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away
We'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things
That I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday, of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away
We'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things
That I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore
I said, last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore, oh

Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da


Last night when my psyche's
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you, too

The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got himself a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit sometimes I fantasize about you, too

In the daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes (sometimes) I fantasize about you, too


I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Because you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Because you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

Because you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Because you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I love
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

Because you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Because you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home


Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, with a bang-go!

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!

Oh there ain't no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes 'n' DJ sets 'n'
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if your looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
From 1984!


When I got back from fixing my hair,
You were directing traffic.
Letting your story slip on the snow as
If the transmission was automatic.
It's arguable
That I shouldn't have been there.
It was fortunate timing.
I had a hole in the pocket
Of my favorite coat
And my love dropped
Into the lining.
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me. I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?)
Not on me
You can't sleep
Until you've sat
On the steps to weep
Until you feel like
You've wept yeah.
(As long as you don't forget your strange)
(Have you got your strange?)
No, not on me. I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange.
I haven't got my strange.


I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)


Blind faith
Heartache
Mind games
Mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to the stones
2000 light years from home

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all

Anything we should know about your change? -- Oh and the cost to correct a fraud
A fraud
I'm going to go out and kid them
Applaud
Applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours

You figure out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette
We think out pathetic sets
We're not sure of the etiquette

And if you found this it's probably too late
Clinically cynical hereditary hate
If you found this it's probably too late
Ever so clinical I'm running out of mates

If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready but probably rough
Frightening honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff


If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no thank-yous, and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rock the words from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches?
And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying be the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known, then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears, then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give


Been trying to think of something colorful for this season
Pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
You are all I have these days, shake it up and run away
With the night squabbling behind you

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

I thought I heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
And I tried but I just can't believe a word they say
Hurry up they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
While the rain's trying to prove a point outside

From the smoke in your hair to the blood in the bruise
And the bows on the shoes you kicked off
I'm joining the dots, I'm joining the dots
I'm joining the dots

Those people make me calm, calm the flame
Come up to the moth for a change
Darling if it's all the same to you, I'll have you to myself
I'm joining the dots, I'm joining the dots


In this room of darkness I ain't undercover
That won't stop my prowess rubbing off on to another
Elevating higher as my body's moving lower
Now I've reached my element you better move over oh

But he doesn't he blocks my way
I try to push past but he wants to play
So I sip his drink as I hold his gaze
Ooh

When we erupt in to the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
So I sink in to the tune
As I inhale the fume
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end to soon

This right here I swear will end to soon

My limbs seem to move what the beat dictates to me
I push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
Taking me back to that sweet familiarity
Making my adrenalin rise I feel the eyes on me

Sip the bottle now don't be slow
Keep up with me as we lose control
Keep up with me as we lose control

When we erupt in to the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
So I sink in to the tune
As I inhale the fume
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end to soon

This right here I swear will end to soon

When we erupt in to the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon


You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of mean streets
You could be my baby

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock

When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock

Watch me... watch me go 
Well I'm struttin' up ever so slow 
And now sting me... get in the groove 
Cause they're bangin' on the door 
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move 

We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 
We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 

(Knock, run) 
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away 
(Knock, run) 
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play 

And I don't mind 
Cause all the time you're talkin' at me 
No I don't mind at all 

Oh well cap-guns and polystyrene planes 
Well I'm buyin' penny bubblies with my change 
Cause sting me... get in the groove 
Cause they're bangin' on the door 
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move 

We're wakin' up those sleepers 
You know we're so mischievous 
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained 
Oh well now she says she's goin' 
That she's got the towel to throw in 
Was just about to blow him and run away! 

(Knock, run) 
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away 
(Knock, run) 
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play 

And I don't mind 
Cause all the time you're talkin' at me 
Well I don't mind at all... no


Well, this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one

Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said they're always exciting words to hear

They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now

They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin
What it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had to

And how can you wake up
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly phased by it
Oh, he had a struggle

They woke up together
Not quite realizing how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And oh, there's nothing left to guess now

Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

Quick, let's leave
Before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done

I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?


Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Draw some ellipses to chase you round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo

Been watching all the neon blossom, flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten, where you've been
Going riding through the thunder circle, fuzz canyon
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Give me an eeny-meeny-miny-moe
Or an ipp dipp, dog-shit rock and roll


Swinging room to room
Planting something new
I've been a riddler I'll do it again
Back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

Riding through the room
Something beautiful
He's riddling the riddler he'll do it again (?)
He's going back to the Wirral where it all began

Wirral riddler

Send a letter to me, baby
I'm on the edge of my seat
Send a letter to me, baby
Little illusion machine

I tried it and I liked it but
It just never gets close enough

Send a letter to me, baby

(Wirral)
So tell me where have you been?
(Wirral)
Little illusion machine
(Wirral)
Hoping tonight is going to send me back to you

Wooow!


Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a Laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
Well I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover

Now I can't think of air without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about something
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover


Ladies, you're damn right
You can't read a man's mind
We're living in two tribes
And heading for war
Well, nobody's perfect
We all gotta work it
But fellas, we're worth it
So don't break the law

Your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind
And I'll be good to you
We're gift-wrapped kitty Kats,
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go, Eskimo
Out into the blue....

Come take my hand, understand that you can,
You're my man 
I need you tonight

Come make my dreams
Honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie (Aii)

I'm just a Love Machine
Feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three 
I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day
'Stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say this time


I've been going crazy while you sleep
Searching for a language that the 2 of us can speak
So, Mr. prehistoric make your wheel

I'll breathe underwater 'cause I like the way it feels

Your call's late, big mistake
You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take
Next time, read my mind
And I'll be good to you

We're gift-wrapped kitty Kats,
We're only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back
Let's go, Eskimo
Out into the blue....

Come take my hand, understand that you can,
You're my man 
I need you tonight
Come make my dreams
Honey, hard as it seems
Loving me is as easy as pie

I'm just a Love Machine
Feeding my fantasy
Give me a kiss or three 
I'm fine
I need a squeeze a day
'Stead of this negligee
What will the neighbours say this time?

Oh, it's very new
Can anybody tell me what to do
Oh, this feeling's very strange
Can anybody tell me what's your game

(Oh) A little education
(Oh) to give you motivation
(Oh) We'll turn the situation round
(Oh) 'cause I don't wanna change ya
(Oh) Making you a stranger
(Oh) I'll only re-arrange ya for now

(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine
(Oh, to give you motivation
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine

(Oh) I'm just a love machine
(Oh, to give you motivation
(Oh) I'm just a Love Machine

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)






Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Yeah they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la
Ooh la la la ooh

You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up


Now then Mardy Bum
I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare

Can't we laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs ,oh when you say I don't care
Well of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on


She was marrying a matador and he was with the weather girl, 
A very clever girl who stood out amongst several once
A terrible dilemma and forever he'll regret this day he didn't make the 
Rescue from the bull ring
Sulking won't get you nowhere son, 
There's blood on your chin where you've bitten your tongue
Smitten but might not be smitten for long if you're still sitting she'll soon
Be smitten and gone


If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak of a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller


He sank into their calculations
And snorted on the stench
Of their arithmetic.
Looked for the boy who was hanging his head low,
More trophies than ideas. To follow their pretence.

With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obidience
And fell in the Nettles.

Afterwards those spikey whispers said he bought his own rope.
And skipped the bits they loathed.
Didn't scramble to find a dock leaf to capture back our hope
To advice his mind had closed
He lost all of his footholes.

He was a toothpick!
And the garlic and the cinder upon the path
Had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
Clinging to the doorframe he was dragged
Off to a reminder of where he had been.

With a smile in his pocket
And a scowl on his face
He had nowhere to flee
So sat content in the Nettles.


Lady, where's your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some it's nowhere to be found

Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
No chance, you'll get nothing from me
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
And he's in turmoil as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can, too?

Lady, where's your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand must he first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more, just once more

Let's go down, down low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she thinks she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can, too?

Her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

An ache in your soul, it's everybody's goal
To get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
But saying it won't change a thing
And now realizing it won't change a thing
Realizing it won't change a thing


So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower knowing full well that I don't
I may suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem

The look of love
The rush of blood
The "she's with me"
The Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs
The camera plus
The black and white and the colour dodge
The good time girls
The cubicles
The house of fun
The number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem


Old yellow bricks
Love's a risk
Quite the little 'escapologist'
Looked so miffed
When you wished
For a thousand places better than this

You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

She was enraged but the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she been dull
Lead to nights readin' beer bottles

You're such a fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from

Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

You're at a loss
Just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was

You are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from

She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
Dorothy was right though


Come and take a leaf out of my book
I'm a crack dealing crook 
Selling lots of rock and roll to the masses 
And I know if you wanna take a trip to the city 
We can go (to Gibraltar) 
We can go (to Gibraltar) 

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 

Give me your switch card
I'll book some flights 

1996 and I'm stuck at the bottom of a truck 
Got the road right in my zone, got detectives 
And I'll say if you catch me that I really wish 
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar) 
That I had stayed (in Gibraltar) 

Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Let's go, let's go, let's go, come on 

Give me your switch card
I'll book some flights


One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road, ooh ooh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?


Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band and all
And back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

I fantasize, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood

Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose the singer must die

Singsong 'round the money tree
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe, I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought


In a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright; he couldn't wait to get away
I bet the Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted

Well, I'm sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
Well, all the little promises - they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Years Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somehow you could have shown you the place you wanted
Well, I sure you could have made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing
What on earth's the plan, has he got one
You better give me some pointers since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true
I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praise or to move in the ways you do
And I never will

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we got in
Near recoups what we're spending

He said
I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay you, how much did they pay you?
You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

'Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

All you people are vampires


I etched a face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Mystery's flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes

I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning

You look like you've been for breakfast
At the Heartbreak Hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Oh, piledriver


He looks as if he hasn't slept
His hair is purposely unkept
And then he know his people wept
When you crafted your plan

Shadows underneath the eyes
And everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game

This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, you're conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
Lying again, your conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination

Is he really on the street?
Desperation or deceit?
And what he's wearing on his feet
Won't solve our mystery

And I am baffled by
How you stand there, soaking it in
And do you hide your identity
Where you hide your grin? Better hide your grin

Shadows underneath the eyes
Everywhere the bastard lies
My lack of proof is your disguise
You won't remember me

There's nothing really I can say
But sorry mate and walk away
I could be wrong unless you play your game

This world is full of most unkind
And horrible is redefined
I can't imagine that you'd mind at all

You're lying again, your conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination
Lying again, conscience in your friend
And the only thing you're sorting out is your imagination



I was biting the time zone, 
And we embellish the banks of our bloodstreams, 
And threw caution to the colorful 
Then we fell asleep in the car, 
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip 
And the tide took me to your mouth, 
And then swept me back down to your palms 

It's them that put me inside the reminder 
That yours is the only ocean, 
(Yours Is the only ocean) 
That I wanna swing from, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna hang on 

I've got this ego mechanic, 
She's always trying to give me vitamins 
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection, 
I preferred her as a cartoon 

If I could be someone else for a week, 
I'd spend it chasing after you, 
'Cause she's not shattering my attitude, 
No matter how she folds the potion 

Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna swing from, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
That I wanna hang on to 

I'm swinging on 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean, 
Yours is the only ocean 

Potion approaching, shield your eyes, 
Potion approaching, visualize, 
Holding a token, swollen in size, 
Potion approaching, shield your eyes 

Oh but if we're gonna escape though, 
We really ought to think it through, 
Would you like me to build you a go kart?


Tricking through the morning, 
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm, 
Shifts past your whiskers, 
So spark is a charm with the barking alarm, 
Weighs coil 'til the corner is turned. 

And the bicycle wheels, all struggle to move round, 
In your muddy mind, 
Blatantly cape town, 
And will intertwine in co-operative time, 
Shall we sit on the springs 'til the mung goes dry? 

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first the chicken or the dickhead? 
Split sleep reeps through rewards and ill fitting thoughts, 
A twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk, 
Your legs start running and your head gets caught, 
Cannot be nineteen, it's perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening, 
Pulled from the after taste, you'll have to slip away, 
And I'm happy to say, 
Behold as the crook in a hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold as the crook in the hammock plays, 
Crawling with the base of the scales, 
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
Gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
Trailing wrapped in a gasp, 

Crawling with the base of the scales, 
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act, 
You were gagged, bound and craft in a tale, 
Trailing wrapped in a gasp. 

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall, 
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms 
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.


He spoke a script
Dipped in the sort of talk to make you keep at bay
It's all a trick
The slicked back slimy arms have got a war to wage

He's got a laugh like a crackling wire
And he wants to put the bite marks on you
He wants to put the bite marks on you
And you twist my guts

As the only thing as repelling as his invitations
Of a dusky serf
And he said 'I am the conductor,
Put me in a terror pocket'

He never slipped
Master in a craft he swept through respectable
Drop a dirty hint if he thinks that he could impress you with the unacceptable

And he has turned through all the pages with his fingers
And covered them with goo
And he wants to put the bite marks on you
He wants to put them on you and it hurts my back

As the only thing that's as heavy as the adoration
Is the days of hanging out on the town
And it's been a long time around
And he frightened me to death when he said
'I am the conductor,
Put me in a terror pocket'

Cause he's trying to give me a ticket to a competition
And I don't know why the odds are stacked
As he's rolling out the running track


Put your dukes up John, 
Yeah, put your dukes up John, 
You were preened and sanitised, 
Struck dumb by good advice. 

Your integrity was bruised, 
Your celebrity a ruse, 
They pulled the rug from under, 
Made way for new pretenders. 

Change your tune and change your hair 
Or you're not going anywhere 
Change your tune and change your hair 
Or you're not going anywhere 
Be a C_Y_N_I_C_ 
Be a C_Y_N_I_C_ 

The profit margin blinds them, 
They groomed and ostracised him, 
His calm makes my blood boil, 
His calm makes my blood boil, 

Change your tune and change your hair 
Or you're not going anywhere 
Change your tune and change your hair 
Or you're not going anywhere 
Be a C_Y_N_I_C_ 
Be a C_Y_N_I_C_ 



I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy island, time-traveling diamond
Could a shaped heartaches
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning

Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?

Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?

Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Are you mine?

She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory

And I can't help myself
All I wanna hear her say is are you mine?
Well are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(Or just mine tonight?)


She's been thinking 
We're fucking off, we're not going home today
And shes been eating too much magic beans
To walk home anyway
?? ?? ?? ?? ??  ground
Put up your picture and
The playful love will get around
Yeah well we'll get around, yeah
Yeah well we'll get around

Everyone's feeling alright
I won't be sleeping today
And I won't be sleeping tonight

We're feeling silly, I'm feeling oh so sick
And I can't see you through the smoke
Because the clouds so thick
And there's a fire and you're dancing
To that disco sound
Put up your picture baby
And the love will get around
Yeah well we'll get around, yeah
Yeah we'll get around

Everyone's feeling alright
I won't be sleeping today
And I won't be sleeping tonight


Topless models
Doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by
And get ignored

Illuminations
On a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing
A reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses
Where teeth collide
When she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby

Those twinkling vixens
With a shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

I left my message but did he forget back to me
And now I'm stuck here wondering
How it's meant to be

Singing a reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade

Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
Reckless serenade


We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up our end, aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no though
He didn't have to be rude

You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Wait, how come it's already two pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous
She were beyond belief
But this lad at her side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

And I'm sitting going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting
'Bout who were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few

Well calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
And they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
They said "no surrender
No chance of retreat"

And so why are they in the taxi?
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

Drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, "Are you sure?"
Went for it but the red light was showing
And red light indicates doors are secured


Take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms,
like a bird of doom
As it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in
the border fires well you know you're never comin back
the humming wires and
Past the square, past the bridge
past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms and
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole,
heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing 
That you can do
He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name
Across this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

You haven't got no money?
He'll get you some
If you haven't got no car, 
He'll get you one
You've got no self-respect,
you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy,
cause here he comes
Through the ghetto and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

You'll see him in your nightmares,
you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but
he's not what he seems
You'll see him in your head and
on the TV screen
hey buddy, I'm warning
you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god,
he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by
his red right hand


So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

Got chased last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking cause they won't find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won't catch me and you

Have you been drinking son, you don't look old enough to me
I'm sorry officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be, cause nobody told me

And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

Thrown in a riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin


Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
And it's on its way back in to scoop you up
But not on my watch

I won't stay with you, my love
The way some science fiction does

Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard on for connectivity
The ascension of the cream
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious

Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
The way some science fiction does
The way some science fiction does

I've got the world on a wire
In my little mirror mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does


So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be all right
Because he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
Sorry love, I'll have to turn you down

And oh, he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around

And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She understands she's here to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
She don't stop in the winter, no and . . .

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all


Fools on parade cavort and carry on 
For waiting eyes 
That you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares 

She swam out of tonight's phantasm 
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear 
There's absolutely nothing for us here 
It's a magnolia celebration 

To be attempted on a Wednesday night 
It's better than to get a reputation 
As a miserable little tyke 
At least that's the conclusion 
She came to in this overture 

The secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing 
She's just giggling along 

Her arms were folded most indignant 
Not looking like she was soon to leave 
I had to squint in order to believe 
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf 

I'm unveiling the unexpected 
How she was never gonna look to? 
Suddenly embarrassed and corrected 
How could such a creature 
Survive in such a habitat 

The secret door swings behind us 
She's saying nothing 
She's just giggling along 
And even if they were to find us 
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied 

At all the fools on parade 
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes 
That you would rather be beside than in front of 
But she's never been the kind 

To be hollowed by the stares 
Fools on parade 
Frolic and fuck about to make her gaze 
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture 

That holds her options 
But you're daft to think she'd care 

Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along


Well, I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour feul up on the flame with your
Jeri can of words and songs

Noone's gonna start a revolution
So why do we even moan?
And there's something that Frankie used to say, apparently
Oh, he said settle for a draw
Cause you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I've told you once I'm sure
I've told you once I'm sure you should settle for the draw
Why don't you settle for the draw?

Well you're right it is one set of rules for her
But then another set for you
But that's just the way it is, I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And let's not fall in the trap of answering back
I am just a beginner
But I know she'll be the winner
That's for sure
So take the draw if it's available

And if it sets on fire
Don't get out your jeri can of
Words and songs

Noone's gonna start a revolution
So you better leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say, apparently
Oh, he said settle for a draw
Cause you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I've told you once I'm sure
I've told you once I'm sure you should settle for the draw


Well, I wrote my number down. 
I'd never wrote it down before. 
I was gonna bring over like something from a film but 
I didn't have the bottle at all. 

Well I had a look and you kept staring. 
Your head pairing up with mine 
Cos your so pretty and I'm so shy. 
You proper did give me the eye though im sure you did 
Well I went outside, couldn't say i tried. 
And I felt regret. 
But in a flash yeah i'd dashed back in. 
Cos the ship had'nt sailed yet. 

And when i did I couldn't see your face 
I could see your mates but that wouldn't do. 
I dashed around to find you 
But you were nowhere to be seen 
Oh no no 

na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na na na na na na na 
na na na na na nooooo 

Well yeah she flew away. 
She seemed like weeks or months away. 
(missing lines) 

Yeah but i learned my lesson though. 
Your so pretty and i'm so shy 


One, two, three, four

She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like fun
She looks like

Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable N.Y.E

(She looks like fun)
Good morning
(She looks like fun)
Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun)
Snowboarding
(She looks like)

Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(She looks like fun)
Bukowski
(She looks like fun)
Dogsitting
(She looks like fun)
Screwballing
(She looks like)

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online
As of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

(She looks like fun)
Key changes
(She looks like fun)
Re-thinking
(She looks like fun)
New order
(She looks like fun)


She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet
For acrobatic blood 
Flow constanting her?
Her cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

Hear who's your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

She's been loop-the-looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots
Give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood?
Constanting her?
Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms


Sketchead
He's coming to your party
He's walking up your drive 
And he's swinging all his keys round
Sketchead
He's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend retain your introductions
Sketchead
That cumbersome protagonist
The pips in your quince
The eye behind the spyhole
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

Sketchead
There's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits
And leave you to your wits
Sketchead
Convincingly insisting the tyres were bald when you gave him the car
Sketchead
Still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive
And still swinging all his keys round on his finger
As a pendulum to un nerve

And then there's you
You've changed
I approach you like you were the same
But soon it was apparant a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your limbs is obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that
They don't prefer the sequel
Will still be swinging on themselves tonight


What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth'

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it


Space invaders flying home
Yeah, they're going to hit the sack
And they are probably going to die getting high
Cause they're mixing crazy with the crack
And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
In July, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
The good old days to tax
Baby, baby, baby
Now won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days to tax
Come on!

It's my big bell bottom cords
And imagine with a hat
And you're a rule breaker, baby
Can't you see me standing?
Only you went ahead and sat

And she's kissing all the boys
She's to clever to be slack
But she's bound to go away for a day
In July, so she won't be coming back

Baby, baby, baby
The good old days to tax
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you dry your pretty eyes
Baby, baby, baby
Your good old days to tax
Come on!


I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space
Ask your mates but golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way
That here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana
Warp speed chic
Hair down to there
Impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

So who you gonna call?
The martini police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright 'cause you love me
And you recognize that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner
Long hot summer
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

So who you gonna call?
The martini police
So who you gonna call?
The martini police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment, yeah
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
It's the star treatment
The star treatment


Won't somebody let me out!
Don't wanna stick around no more
I said they're looking at yer strange
I said yer stickin' to the floor

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Fucking hell I'll break your nose
If they keep on pushing you around
Keep on stepping on your toes
I'll pick you up when you fall down

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
Said not one of you, no

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer
So now one of you's gonna have to stop!

Ah ah, ah ah, oh!
Ah ah, ah ah, oh
Yea, yea, yea!

Not one of you's got an ounce of style in yer


Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling, I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact that everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said, you don't know nothing

Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it, yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh and you say you have forgotten but you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

Oh-woah, woah, woah
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Oh-woah, woah, woah

Oh, so what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said, what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing

I fancy you with a passion
Oh, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar, too
But you're a fad and you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright, yeah, I'll put it on one side
Oh, 'cause everybody's looking, you've got control of everyone's eyes including mine


Open Sesame. (We've places to go)
We've people to see. (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make
When you want to escape say the word

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Eyes the colour of, (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust. (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world cause I wanna, get off, with you.

Well I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna, get off, with you.


Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just Postmix lemonade

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you

I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for

Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"

Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you


Leave me alone
I'm in control, I'm in control
And girls act too much and boys act too tough
Enough is enough

We're on the minds of other men I know she was
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

I say, he's going to let you down
He's going to let you down
He's going to let you down
And going to break your back for a chance
And going to steal your friends if he can
He's going to win someday

I fell off the track
Now I can't go back
I'm not like that
Boys act too much, girls act too tough
Enough is enough

Well on the minds of other girls I know he was
I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it

I say, he's going to let you down
He's going to let you down
He's going to let you down
And going to break your back for a chance
And going to steal your friends if he can
He's going to win someday
Oh he will


Despair to the point will they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen

Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top one hundred list

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

She saw it, and she grabbed it, and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
Do you reckon that they do it for a joke?
Do you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says 'we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around

When did your list replace the twist and turn
Ah, the fist replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time, and it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
He told ya that you were dying for it

Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Let's have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick, and you're getting thicker

Assuming that all things are equal
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you?


I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The first thing that she said

Temptation, greets you like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
But one you could never bring yourself to hate

And she said we've got that spark
That only lights a fuse
Helps you see in the dark
But it's a sight you'll lose when
The temptation greets you like your naughty friend

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

Temptation greets you like your naughty mate
One that made you steal and set things on fire
But one you haven't seen of late

And I said that kind of talk
Only adds intrigue
To the cauldron of thought
It's already exceeding
Temptation, the very thing that held her back

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it

And your hands where I can

We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends
Caused enticement in the air
I mean day 'n' night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, joyriding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless gangsters, no direction
No sign of correction
But then I switched it off
Changed my ways
What the hell
Like oh my days
But like my naughty friends
They're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just what
But its hard to fight the temptation son

The panic will fall down around you
If you don't do what I say

I don't ever want to hate you
So don't show me your bed
The only roads are cul-de-sacs
The only ends are dead

I don't ever want to hate you
It's not part of the plan
So keep your charm where I can't see it
And your hands where I can


A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

Jealously in Technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Street lamp amber, wanderlust
Hide her in a blunderbus

She looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one,
That time has got it in for honey

That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong


Made me kiss ya' with a whisper
And violently you swung, through unfamiliar tongue
Couldn't listen to tradition, grabbed me by the wrist to silently insist

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

You stood shirtless and confident
Listenin' to the fools, tickling the rules
Their obsessions follow patterns
Sat upon their stools, with their attitudes

And when I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at

When I'm in the confines of crawling walls, you hold me in place
The ripples on the ceiling the avenues, unsugared taste
Waste away the evening, the afternoon, the afternoon's hat
Together we'll find something to direct some laughter at.


Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh, the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me, but it's alright
She's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
I've been before
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore
Well, she's talkin', but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse

Oh, I'm standing at the bar and somebody's partner's talkin' to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew how she could have anyone she wants
And I'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response

Like, I don't mind
Be a big mistake
For you to wait
And let me waste your time
Really, love, it's fine
Really, love, it's fine

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh, but she carried on suggestin' a struggle to refuse
She said, 'it's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse.'


I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
or sat on a tatty settee
at some mutual friend's gathering
and the more you keep on looking
the more it's hard to take
love, we're in stale mate
to never meet is surely where we're bound
there's one in every town
just there to grind you down
I wish I would have seen you in the post office
well maybe I did and I missed it
too busy with a mind on clever lines
why not the rounders pitch or the canteen 
you're slacking love, where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight
so give me the invite
don't worry it's alright
I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
sipping on a lemonade in the paper cup and chewing on the straw
and I wish I would have seen you in the bakery
but if I'd seen you in the bakery you probably wouldn't have seen me


Black as a beacon
In a river of shimmering fog
Yes she was

If you were heat seeking
She was hard to ignore
Yes she was

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty one

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Well Time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand

And she snapped
Wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty one

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady - 
She floats like an niccy rush but she stings like a bee
flat 

The Blond-o sonic shimmer trap
And she snapped the wing mirrors off a Cadillac
With a particular pretty ones

And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on


[Instrumental]


Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults and it leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow her candles out just to see if you glow in the dark

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Home sweet home, home sweet home, home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism and put 'em in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated in the eye of the storm

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

Oh, and in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgment's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun

Well did you ever get the feeling
Did you think she set the fall
Her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
What you waiting for to sing another fuckin'

Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala


Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake 
Though it caresses once again irritate 
Tread softly stranger 
Move over toward the danger THAT you seek 

You think excitement has receded 
And the mirror distracts 
The logic of the trance 
Quickly reaches and grasps 
Handsome and faceless 
And weightless, your imagination roams 

And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

In the moonlight they're more thrilling 
Those things that he knows 
As he leads you through the grinning 
Bubble blowers in the snow 
Watching his exit 
Is like falling off the ferry in the night 

The inevitables gather to push you around 
Any old voice makes a punishing sound 
He became laughter's assassin 
Shortly after he showed you what it was 

And now it's no ones fault but yours 
At the foot of the house of cards 
You thought you'd never get obsessed 
You thought the wolves would be impressed 
And you're a sinking stone 
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweler's hand 
That procession of pioneers all drowned 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
I'm listening, ready to learn 
There's no one here to police me, 
I'm sinking in, until you return 

If you've a lesson to teach me, 
Don't deviate, don't be afraid 
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, 
Let's get it ingrained


Up from the pastures of boredom
out from the sea of discontent
they come in packs like hungry hounds
the seekers of the dark enchantment.

They haunt the boulevards and bars
they pray to wishing wells and stars
they ride the hurricane of hope
not looking back but on they go
toward the distance and deceiving
and all the while they keep believing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when they pair off two by two
they feel they are the chosen few
and though their beds are made of straw
they feel like velvet in the night
and so the night is never ending
it's made of distance and pretending
because they're special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love goes away
and when goes...
goodbye...
catches in their throats like cotton
rises in their hearts like rain
the good times suddenly are all forgotten
the hunt begins again.

They search the subways and the streets
their faces tired, like their feet
their bodies aching to be warm
and so they hide behind the moon
their loneliness inside them growing
but they take comfort in just knowing
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.

And when love comes again
and when love comes
hello...
rises from their throats like singing
catches in their hearts like wind
the good things
strangers in their arms are bringing
makes life all right again.

They turn their faces to the light
no longer hiding in the night
so unashamed and unafraid
that they can face each other's faults
and though the waltz will have its ending
there is no harm in just pretending
that they are special and apart
the lovers, the lovers of the heart... the lovers.


When you leave us through the patient doors
That rattle in you ear will be the sound of our applause
raptuous, considered and due.
Oh the nasty laughter and desperate smirks
are tangled in the boredom where out brittle kisses lurk
well how can i believe you, when you can't believe your luck

and the shardes of past attraction lie visible
but shy and blunt and weak and worn
away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

oh the shardes of past attraction lie visible
but shy and blunt and weak and worn
away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak

in the trap
you only want to be the first to laugh
you only want to be the first in the sandtrap
you only want to be the first to laugh

and your climbing holes and cinder claws
ring out the the ? all towards

Farwell, Farewell Farewell


Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called
That thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
Didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch
Or some big event

What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
And dress like a fictional character
From a place they called America
In the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just trying to orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once


Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite forlorn in bunny ears and devil horns and how

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen

I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that you can never beat the bandit, no

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that is said is that you've drank a lot

And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind yeah
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out
For a reason it would block
Oh you send her after nine o' clock

Anticipation has a habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah regardless of what's gone before

And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that is said is that you've drank a lot

And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind yeah
You should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

And you can pour your heart out
Around three o' clock
When the two-for-ones have done the writer's block


You push the button and we'll do the rest
The exotic sound of data storage
Nothing like it
First thing in the morning
You push the button and we'll do the rest
Bastard latin
That's the best thing for it
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind 'round a lullaby
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

Pattern language in the mood for love
You push the button and we'll do the rest

You and Jeanie wearing stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

The world's first ever monster truck front flip
I'm just a bad girl trying to be good
I've got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

Forward thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest


There's a room for the trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones that make sinners out of such lovely lads

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end

There's a room for the trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones that make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
All the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around just so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life, not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk, though
Look what it's done to your friends; their memories are pretend
And the last thing they want is for the feeling to end


The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns am I too quick to assume
That the love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune

To what they did before, her heads red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like they're happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more

And no would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She says, "see if it's still raining
I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"
And I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Locked in tempestuous phase
At least that's how we felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier and whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery

Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me as sunday's frozen pitch
Fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back


Oh baby, I'm wanting to do you a swap 
I'll give you anything, yeah 
In return for the noises you've got 
And I can see you want to be attended to 
Just count to twenty-nine and I'll attend to you 
Oh for sure... well certainly, yeah yeah yeah 
Wavin' bye to the train or the bus 
I'm ever so worried because... 
I don't want to get all forgotten... 

So very comfortable.. 
Don't really need to put up my feet, 
And even in fat sam's grand slam, 
Can't see it being easier to speak. 
when you've karate-kicked your way to someone new 
And I'm a memory and don't know what to do 
All on his own... 
Collecting his dole n' stuff 

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus 
I'm ever so worried because... 
I don't want to get all forgotten... 
Cause we know 
Yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh 
Oh we know, a woah-oh-oh 

Don't know where we're going, baby 
I s'pose it depends 
But even if we're all far apart 
We can all come back and all be fine 
We'll be able to be together again 

Be together again 
Be together again 
Be together again 
... 
Everybody will be together again!


Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And does it get on your nerves, make it slightly perturbed
That there's things that you don't know about her
And even the places that she's never been with you
Seem awful empty without her

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?

Betwixt and between the fantasy dream and the fear
Do you wonder where she is this afternoon?
And with the needle in groove, is there all to prove
And tell me are your feet still tapping?
I know there's a first for a trip over the water
What is the worst that could happen?

You can look into those eyes
Down no telephone line
What if you were right the first time?


So who's that girl there? 
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
He told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

Although you're trying not to listen
I bet your eyes are staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down

And oh he must be up to something
Want half a chance to show he's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around, here

And look here comes a ford mondeo
Isn't he mister inconspicuous
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up

And she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
And don't stop in the winter no and

They said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Around here

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all


We all want some one to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been, where we've been

Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you

Just because we're having a say so
Not lining up to be Play-Doh
In five years time will it be
Who the fuck's arctic monkeys?

'Cause everybody's got there box
And doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns

Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

All the thoughts that I just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

It's not you it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue

It's not you it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape, yeah?


The mirror's image
It tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side

And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner
Well are you out tonight?

It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
(Message you reply)
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
(Why'd you only call me when you're)
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

And I can't see you here when I'm high
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found all I was hoping to find
You said you got to be up in the morning
Gonna have an early night
And you starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?


I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't try and turn out the lights
Act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I'm in love tonight
Won't you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart, you're the one that should break it
The engine's running, can't decide if I should ride away

You and I
You and I

I had a woman
She went away
And now I'm lonely
Fuck it

You and I
You and I

You and I
You and I

Tell me where you're gonna take it
If I had a heart, you're the one that should break it
The engine's running can't decide if I should ride away

You and I
You and I

You and I!

You and I

You and I!
You and I!

I like the way you look at me baby
Please don't go and turn out the lights
Act as if I'm not going crazy
Girl I need your love tonight


Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed, with my ex boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throws,
this is when my buzzer goes

Run out to meet your chicks and bitter
You say when we're married cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

Then you notice lickle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya, I was troubled
You know that I'm no good


One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak when you're coming up to speak

And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit frank spencer? 
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it
Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks

Never again
Never again, will there be another one that's as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on there stupid faces


You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes and your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple A passes
At the cemetary gates

Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, babe
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw your driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Coach-esque
You watch Italian horror and you listen to the scores
Leather-clad and spike collar
I want you down on all fours

Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

I know you're nothing like mine
Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
Cause I don't shun the daylight
But baby I'm willing to start

You're so dark 

Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allen Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby


It's all the same thing
Now that it ever was
Except now you've strayed too far
Need you to stop digging your hole
And follow the path we light
Don't need an invitation to be reconciled
'Cause these home fires are burning
Stare into your empty eyes and wonder...

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
You spent your time making excuse
For the ways of life that you are choosing
How could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am
The more we organize
We suck out this life that serves as the fuel behind

You want to take the passion in my veins
And put it down in black and white
You've got your foot directly on the gas
I watch you burn out so fast
Now I can see just what you've become

And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am
And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly where I am

(One) one thousand (good) intentions
(Lost) translation (lost) forever
(One) one thousand (good) intentions
(Lost) translation (lost) forever
Lost

How could something so right turn out so wrong?
I don't have a backup plan
This is all that I am
And how could something so right turn out so wrong?
Not sure exactly
Where I am
Where I am


Aside from the name that holds us together
Now I think we'd fall apart
It's the years we'll pretend we've forgotten
What separates our hearts

And I don't remember the way this was
But the pictures prove I knew you once

And where is the source of our mistakes?
I'm afraid one day we'll drift so far
We'll wake up not knowing where we are
These words accomplish nothing if I'm gone


So honestly. 
The way your body tells the story of the summer nights you spent away from me. 
And honestly, there is no other place I'd rather be. 
So sound the alarms. 

It's going to take more than a miracle to save me from your charms. 
So sound the alarms. 
It's going to take more than a miracle. 
And every smile that you fake could be your last. 

Spend another night here living in the past. 
And every smile that you fake could be your last. 
Spend another night at home. 
And suddenly, I'm seeing clearly in the places that you always kept from me. 

And suddenly, there is no other place I'd rather be.


As I watch your life go up in flames,
You'll swear up and down you'd like to change
But when the sun sinks slowly into the sky,
Now you're right
Where you started again with nothing to say,
Without an argument or case
And when it's said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes, inside your eyes

When will you stop and realize,
The worth and value of your life?
As you suffocate yourself within this mindless,
Nine to five wake up! there's more!
And your life is nobody's but yours
And now its said and done and done and said,
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes

You're running circles around my slow pace
You've reached the finish line only to realize there was no race
I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose
I give and take and now I've taken all I could

And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could (now I've taken, now I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could


There's a struggle coming, but to conquer,
First they must divide.
The machines keep humming night and day.
How are we so unaware,
Why are you not afraid?

Protests are drumming while you turn
Your nose and roll your eyes,
Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained.
Judging from an arm chair.

'Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss,
But there is light and there is dark, then there is us.
And whether this world burns, is none of your concern,
Caught up in a ticker-tape parade.

I have learned to stand up and just to walk away,
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate.
Learn to let go, learn to walk away.
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame,
But this time I'm here to stay.

Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine,
True colors shining through,
As we are stripped of our exteriors.

Now, cause there is hate
And there is love and there is loss,
But there is right and there is wrong, then there is us.
We're falling until

We learn to stand up and just to walk away,
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate.
Learn to let go, learn to walk away.
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame,
But this time I'm here to stay

Feet first into the quicksand,
Every day we are surrendering,
Never straying from the game plan.
I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up.

The water's overflowing, the walls are breaking,
But I know where I'm going, that we can make it
And there's a light still glowing and I will chase it.
And I've been lost before and I have been led astray,

But this time I'm here to stay


The pain, disorder
A cataclysmic dawn
We trusted but something has gone wrong
We bought it
But woke to find it gone
Impact in 5, 4, 3, 2

The place before
The radiation creeps
On cats' feet
We scatter in the streets
She asks me "do you think it's safe to breathe?"
It doesn't look that way to me

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough

Afraid, we cower
To interests not our own
The power to free or to control
We let it skip through
Our fingers to the bone
Watch as the bodies wash ashore
Whoa
Nobody lives here anymore

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough

And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
How long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall?

And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
How long, how?

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoa
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough


A death knell sounds
No matter where I go
A city or small towns
All I want
Is something to call my own
But I'm in the dark now

We set up confidently
But what if we were wrong
We shound have been there long ago
Shouldn't take this long
We stumbled accidentally
To a place unknown

CHORUS
It's about damn time we swallow the pain
Before it spreads
Memories we don't want to know
I still wake up with the same song 
And it's stuck in my head
The melody always take me home
Take me home

(Take me home)

I'm standing now
Waiting with both eyes closed
For whatever is left
A fist smacks down
Black eyes and broken bones
Maybe a soft kiss

I'm tired of always guessing
Whether the sky will fall
It's time to learn my lesson
I forget it all
The time we spend preparing
We always miss it all

CHORUS

To save the broken branch
We cut them in half
You said "I wish I could help you"
I said "You already have"

CHORUS

Take me home


Now's the time
To rearrange your life
Live for something
Outside of your own mind
We all dream
The same dream every night
To burn the world that you call civilized

Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
I'll never understand
The who, what, why or when
Of you tonight...

We face the stares of judgment
And almost everyday
The shaking heads
Of disapproval say
"Pray for you to give me something then find out that there was nothing left"

Recite the words inside (your heart)
Realize that this is nothing
Without your voice
I'm not giving up
And I'll blame the worst on you
I know what's wrong

Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
And I don't need to explain
Myself to you


Information kept to myself and everyone wants to know,
I trust the words of nobody else cause I've been there before,
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
The calloused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen,
These eyes don't wander as far as they at one time did,
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now

I'm on the other end begging you, pick up the phone,
A shaking whisper is answering, don't call anymore your voice is wasted 'cause no one's listening
Freeze me in that moment, thaw me in ten years,
When the fires burned out and the smoke (clears)

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now

Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight will never end
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight
Will never end

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now


Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Anyway you want it

She loves to dance
She loves to sing
She does everything

She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves a lot of things

All night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Oh baby, hold tight

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

I was alone, I never knew
What good love could do
Then we touched and we sang
About the lovely things

All night, all night
Oh, every night
So hold tight, hold tight
Oh baby, hold tight

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said, all night, all night
All night, oh baby, hold tight

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

And she said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Oh, every night

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Oh baby, hold tight

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Oh, every night


We've been alright up to now,
But the air that we breath is about to run out.
We've rehearsed our lines clear and loud,
But the cue never came and the lights,
They never went out.
So we're passing the time,
While time passes us.
The fast lanes a term never applied to us.
Without a dime to my name,
Or a prayer in the world.
I walk out the door.

Destination anywhere but here.
Away from you.

Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)

So I dropped out of my own race,
A race with no finish line,
No first or last place.
I watch these faces all run right past me.
I turn and walk away,
'Cause we finally know now what our
Time here's about, we were not meant to be
Another face in the crowd.
We're a forest of lives,
We grow tall and wide.
We won't ever be cut down.

Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)

I'm so tired and turned around and scared.
I'm lying in empty beds again.
I'll wait for you to come
To your senses, barbed-wire fences
Won't keep me from breaking through.
I swear I will for you.

Now I'm on my way to the other side,
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind.
(On my way)
These empty rooms,
(On my way)
Are still filled with you.
(On my way)

I'm so tired and turned around and scared.
I'm lying in empty beds again.
Away from you.


Are there no fighters left here anymore?
Are we the generation we've been waiting for?
Are we patiently burning, waiting to be saved?

Our heroes are icons that mellow with age
Following rules that they once disobeyed
They're now being lead when they used to lead the way

Do you still believe in all the things
That you stood by before?
I hope they're on the front lines
Or at home keeping score
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate
Or would you rather be the architect
Of what we might create?

Go!

They laid out the blueprints
They poured down a base
Concrete solutions to slow our decay
But when they are gone
Who the fuck's gonna take their place?

Yeah, will it be the cynic, the critics galore
They say how pathetic passed out on the floor
This trustee complicit
Who collectively ignore

Do you still believe in all the things
That you stood by before?
I hope they're on the front lines
Or at home keeping score
Do you care to be the layer of the bricks that seal your fate
Or would you rather be the architect
Of what we might create?

Don't you remember when you were young
And you wanted to set the world on fire?
Somewhere deep down, I know you do
And don't you remember when we were young
And we wanted to set the world on fire?
'Cause I still am, and I still do
Make no mistake, we are not afraid
To bear the burden of repeating
What they're thinking anyway
Let's raise the stakes
On the bet we made
Let's decide to be the architects
The masters of our fate

Yeah, we still believe in all the things
That we stood by before
And after everything we've seen
Maybe even more
I know we're not the only ones
And we were not the first
And unapologetically
We stand behind each word


I can still remember
The words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers
In years of wet cement
The days blurred into each other
Though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed
But then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then we should have stayed

But we ran away
Now all my friends have gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Runaway
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

Identities assume us
As nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches
To the seconds that we lost
I looked up and saw you
I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment
In empathy

I brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name
And you ran away
Now all my friends have gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Runaway
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

We're all OK, until the day we're not
The surface shines, while the inside rots
We raced the sunset and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

But we ran away
Now all my friends have gone
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved
Runaway
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?


I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see your steps walk back
I watched the walls all crash down, crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slipped

We threw suds in the oceans winding
We promised peace but the peace won't last
'Cause now we forged new brakes so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass

I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel
I see it all

I've been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep

We fell in love but the love kept running out
We follow roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned, and learned to live without
Falling from the matters we assemble

I've seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I've seen the child of a violent man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began

I can't look away, or pretend not to see
And so I say

I've been awake too long
Wish there was something that could close my eyes
To all that I see
Awake too long
It would be easier to fall asleep

Asleep

Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I'd see what this could be
Instead of what you know
And is there bliss in ignorance?
Is this our demise we can't prevent?
Should we fall asleep?

I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long
I've been awake too long

(I've been awake too long) And like constant vigils we all
(I've been awake too long) Carry eternal flames
(I've been awake too long) I'm saturate pains to an open heart
(I've been awake too long) But through it all
Every single cut I've been awake


Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born


Chairs thrown and tables toppled,
Hands armed with broken bottles,
Standing no chance to win but,
We're not runnin', we're not runnin'.

There's a point I think we're missin',
It's in the air we raise our fists in,
In the smiles we cast each other,
My sister, my brother.

About the time we gave up hope and
We never find these locks still open,
Stumbling on stones unturned,
The hurt we feel, we all have found.

The lines we've crossed in search of change, but all they see is treason

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Bonfires burn like beacons,
Guiding the lost and weakened.
Flames dance on crashing waves,
Guiding ships who've gone a stray

Time out, let's stop and think this through,
We've all got better things to do,
A talk in circles run in place,
Answers inches from my face.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Black eyes, broken fingers,
Blood drips and I let it run down my lips and to my swollen gums
When hope is non-existent,
Our instincts all scream, "Run",
We never turn our backs or even bite our tongue.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.

Although we have no obligation, to stay alive
On broken backs we beg for mercy, we will survive
(Break out) I won't be left here
Behind closed doors.


Simply because you can breathe
Doesn't mean you're alive
Or that you really live
This life has taken its toll
She just doesn't know
How much more she can give

But here, at the top of the world
Where I raise my hands, and I clench my fists
And they stand before me, below
Demanding the answers with flips of a switch

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply ingrained in your head
That this world is something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less

A need for revolution rising
It comes to the surface, gasping for air
And we're not putting up with this planet
One more day, much less one more year

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply ingrained in your head
That this world is something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less

So here, and now, in our rotting nation
The blood, it pours, it's all on our hands now
We live, in fear, of our own potential
To win, to lose, it's all on our hands now

And I have an American dream
But it involves black masks and gasoline
One day I'll turn these thoughts into screams
At a world that turned its back down on me

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply ingrained in your head
That this world is something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less


What if I'm right and you are wrong?
What if you knew it all along?
What if I figured out that I did not belong?

What if it always bothered me?
What if I never did believe?
Would it be wrong if I decided I should leave?

If I pretended I was blind
And struck it from my mind
Would it still be there?
What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right
It's all right

What if it's all inside my head?
What if those words were never said?
Would it be easier if I could just forget?

What if I didn't run away?
Could it be any other way?
Would it be wrong if I decided I should stay?

If I pretended I was blind
And struck it from my mind
Would it still be there?
What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

And now, if I pretended I was blind
And struck it from my mind
Would it still be there?
What if I'd do anything to make it seem all right
It's all right

Yeah, what if I'm right and you are wrong?
What if you knew it all along?
What if I figured out that I did not belong?

What if it always bothered me?
What if I never did believe?
Would it be wrong if I decided I should leave?


so come test, so come and break me, so come on intoxicate me with hands tied behind my back, I fight and wait for you to strike
a new problem we can't stop them, we're outnumbered and uncautioned, a rally cry ring out into the night
so pride yourself on what you are, hold them all to words they can't take back, I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams where fires die but light still shines for us to see
what did you have to say? give me your logic, your definition, the words you twist to justify your position of mass starvation and blind airstrikes, every problem is solved with a fight
peace won't be found, til we're underground, as long as we live without a sound
so pride yourself on what you are, hold them all to words they can't take back, I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams where fires die but light still shines for us to see
would God bless a murder of the innocents?
would God bless a war based on pride?
would God bless a money-hungry government? no.
would God bless our ineffective court system?
God bless the sweatshops we run.
would God bless Amerika?
God bless Amerika. 



This place rings with echoes of
Lives once lived but now are lost
Time spent wondering about tomorrow
I don't care if we lose it all tonight
Up in flames, burning bright
Warming the air of the world

I don't love you anymore' is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
I have no more blood to bleed
As my heart has been draining into the sea

Since I've taken your footsteps
Getting me closer to what is left
Of the dreams of what I once claimed to know

Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?

I don't love you anymore' is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
I have no more blood to bleed
As my heart has been draining into the sea

Still I wait
With a hope inside of me (inside of me)
So still (so still) I wait (I wait)
Until again we meet
Until again we meet

Within my bones this resonates
Boiling blood will circulate
Could you tell me again what you did this for?

I don't love you anymore' is all I remember you telling me
Never have I felt so cold
I have no more blood to bleed
As my heart has been draining into the sea

Still I wait
With a hope (so still) inside of me (I wait)
So still (a hope) I wait (inside of me)


The boy's no good. 
Yeah, he's a fuckin' hood. 
He won't treat you like he should. 
I heard he's making time with this friend of mine. 
I heard he's talking trash. 
I saw that kid last night. 
He's starting fights. 
He's got that nervous twitching. 
He's just not the kid for you. 
He's all dressed up. 
He's got nothing to do, but he's got something. 
He's cool as anything, but he's not good. 
That boy's a fucking creep.

The boy's no good. 
Yeah, he's a hood. 
He won't treat you like he should. 
I said the boy's no good. 
He's a hood. 
He won't treat you like I would. 
I said the boy's no good. 
Listen to what I say. 
The boy's no good. 
He'll fuck you anyway. 
The boy's no good. 
I'm gonna have a talk... the boy's no good. 
The boy's no fuckin' good.


When faith alone is not enough,
To keep our heads barely above,
We look for reason and come up empty-handed.
And when our children fight our wars,
While we sit back just keeping score,
We're teaching murder not understanding now.

We're setting the fires to light the way,
We're burning it all to begin again,
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands,
We sing for change

The lives we bury sons that lay
We'll cancel debts we've yet to pay,
How could we justify anything now,
As long as we blindly obey and do exactly what they say,
We'll have no one to blame but ourselves now.

We're setting the fires to light the way,
We're burning it all to begin again,
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands,
We sing for change.

We run on the fumes of injustice,
We'll never die with the fuel that you give us,
Keep it coming 'cause I'm prepared to burn,
Keep running from me at every turn.

Your life around,
(into something true, into something true)
So turn your life around,
(into something true, something true)

We're setting the fires to light the way,
We're burning it all to begin again,
With hope in our hearts and bricks in our hands,
We sing for change.


In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long

There's a place that I'd rather be
There's a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, whoa
Is where we let ourselves been led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
We may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Who once you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
Without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps it's arms around
White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me
Praying, she asks me for a favor
Catch me if I fall

A rush of blood straight to the head, whoa
I wonder what this could have been

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
We may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Who once you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands
Hey!

No I never meant to hurt you
No I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waiting while the man said move along

We lay the tracks down
But now they rotted
Like a runaway train
We brace for the crash

We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
Like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap

We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Now we brace for the crash)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
And underneath the shadows we now live


We crack the code, we transmit coordinates
Black the glass, windows and doors
Searchlights swing low, we duck and we roll
The voice on the wire is calling

Broadcast, signal, frequency, the lights go out
But what if they're just listening to every sound?

Channel the paranoia, wiretap to destroy their confidence from inside out
Hijack the messages, disguise the origin, spin it back around

Broadcast, signal, frequency, the lights go out
But what if they're just listening to every sound?
What if they are listening?
What if they are listening?
Is anybody listening?
What if they are listening right now?

The voices are scrambled, the wires are crossed and tangled
The firewall collapsing, but we're still broadcasting

And the voices are scrambled, and the wires are crossed and tangled
And the firewall is collapsing, but we're still broadcasting now

You can't tune us out!

Broadcast, signal, frequency, the lights go out
But what if they're just listening to every sound?
What if they are listening?
What if they're just listening?
Broadcast, signal, frequency
Is anybody listening right now?


Our buildings have fallen
Our walls all caved in,
And we can't comprehend this sad state
That we're in so we sift through the ashes
Of what we've become and surrender
Here one by one, so push us down

And we get right back up again
The things you're telling me aren't making any sense
Right back up again
I'm sick of wishing for someone else to come

Let the blind lead the blind
'Cause it's eye for an eye in your so called life
Are you out there? are you listening?
Is there something we're still missing?
Let the blind lead the blind,
'Cause it's eye for an eye, we all fall down

And we get right back up again,
The things you're telling me aren't making any sense
Right back up again
I'm sick of wishing for someone else to come

We're spinning out of control
We're trying to find somewhere to land
And I don't want you to know
The things that keep me down
We get right back up again


Hey, man did you hear
Your final days are near?
A freefall of fire and ice
And explosions in the sky

A fate that we deserve
There's no escaping
No it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

Hey, hey!

Hey, man, you got the time?
Hey, can I trouble you for a light
No, me? no, I'm not the old town cryer
I'm the one who sets it all on fire

A fate that we deserve
And there's no escaping
No, it's your turn
Now it's your turn

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face

We hide from the mirrors
They might show our scars
And hear us
Reflection that we want to be
The people we are (the people we are)
Fight your reflection
Smash what you see
And let's restart
'Cause mirrors can't see our heart

It's been years
Since our luck ran out and left us here
Like broken mirrors
Ten million shards of glass and tears
But now we are
Awake enough to show what we hear
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Like broken mirrors
Reflections of an unfamiliar face


Invest time, invest life
Invest it all, reinvent yourself
Before you know it
Your essence is renewed with something fresh
Your will, your way
Will earn respect in your day
Let the glory sharpened knife
Carve the future of your life

let's not praise the past, just a fact
Built to last
Old school or the new
Doesn't mean a thing if your heart's not true
Greedy ones faded fast, we're here
Built to last
For the fun, not a fad
The love and the truth so powerful

work out the snags of the past
Work out the snags that won't last
Mistakes have finished my brothers
Mistakes will guide all the others
Your will, your way
Might shape a better day
Eradicate the stagnancy
Eradicate it like disease

let's not praise the past, just a fact
Built to last
Old school or the new
Doesn't mean shit if your heart ain't true
Greedy ones faded fast, we're here
Built to last
For the fun, not a fad
The love and the truth so powerful
The love and the truth so powerful

as we've seen around the world
We won't go away
Cause we'll always feel this way
We're here to stay
And our impact will be felt
We won't go away
If we feel it, if we feel it
We're here to stay
Built to last


Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Thank you for your silence, your continuing compliance
It's your buried head so deep in sand that ushered in the virus
(Oh, no)
Please don't lift a finger
Don't get up, just sit right there (Oh, no)
Don't worry about the thoughts
Inside your pretty little head

So we stick to the script and recite your lines
Don't break from the character, just keep it inside

But this is bullshit (Bullshit)
It's finally coming into focus (Focus)
You're lying and I think you know it
But you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create
Yeah, this is bullshit (Bullshit)
And did you think I wouldn't notice? (Notice)
Cracks in your theory are showing like a broken vase
Your grip around me dissipates

And we are separated only by divisions and the walls that we create
(And we are separated only by divisions and the walls that we create)
But we are more alike than different when we stop and take a minute face to face
(But we are more alike than different when we stop and take a minute face to face)
They say we're divided
And we are conquered
Yeah, but our enemies have never been each other, no

'Cause this is bullshit (Bullshit)
It's finally coming into focus (Focus)
You're lying and I think you know it
But you're too afraid to face the storm you helped create
Yeah, this is bullshit (Bullshit)
And did you think I wouldn't notice? (Notice)
Cracks in your theory are showing like a broken vase
Your grip around me dissipates

So we scale the walls and fire escapes
A wheat paste brush and cans of paint
To cover up your walls with something new
'Cause we all know
Your signs say we're not good enough
Not cute enough, not smart enough
Not worth your love, out with the old
And in with something new

(Bullshit, it's coming around
But this is bullshit, it's not slowing down
This is bullshit, and it always was
And this is bullshit, and you know it)

Bullshit, not sorry to say
But this is bullshit, you've been lying to me
Bullshit, and it always was
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know

That this is bullshit coming right at you
Bullshit coming home to roost
Bullshit and you're too afraid
To face the storm you helped create
This is bullshit
This is bullshit
Bullshit and you're too afraid
To face the storm you helped create


Breathe deep and easy, swallow this pride.
Stare at my shaking hands though bone dry, blood shot eyes.
Clock strip the hours, I count the miles.
Will you be there waiting, awake until sunrise.

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days,
I crawl from these sinkholes collapsed under this weight
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine,
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight.

In the glow of twilight, our world is finally calm.
I felt it complete me, when the stars give way to dawn.
A language universal, but I speak not his tongue.
Is this a night that spans forever, or a dawn that never comes.

I have traveled in darkness, for what seems like days,
I, come from the same house, collapsed under this wing.
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine,
So say you'll stay and dance with me tonight.

Tomorrow we might wake in servitude and service?
I will give you everything if you would only have me!
Tomorrow we will sweat and toil,
Our hands will quiver caked with soil,
Tomorrow we'll give it one last chance,
But tonight we dance,
But tonight we dance!

And for this, I travel in darkness, for what seems like days,
I, come from the same house, collapsed under this wing.
I know not your sorrow, but I know mine,
Just say you'll stay and dance with me tonight.


Tell me how these things traced with colors filled with black debris
And how these loyal, living Reich were nameless things swept out of sight
Dead through the streamers on the sky past neon words where we
Remember those killed by names we each call, are you happy where you are?

Blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry our weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Let's go!

And so we carry on each day as if our lives were not so real
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
First bouts of delirium and scenes of homeless Democrats
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality

I'm blind to this impending fate
We'll let the world carry their weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But they all live in denial

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've begun?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Can we be saved, has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine


When our rivers run dry and our crops cease to grow
And when our summer grow longer and winters won't snow
From the banks of the ocean and the ice in the hills
To the fight in the desert where progress stands still
When we've lost our will

That's how we'll know, this is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all fall from grace

When the air that we breathe becomes air that we choke
When the marsh fever spreads from the swamps to our homes
When your home on the range has been torn down and paved
The buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave
What more will it take?

For us to know this is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
Kissing the ground as we all fall from grace

This is a chance to set things straight
To bend or break the rules back into place
There is no middle ground, no compromise
We've drawn the line

With perfect aim, we stand back and throw
Glass windows break and it's all about to blow
Lights go out as we pass the torch again
In hope that is stays lit, oh

Neutrality means that you don't really care
'Cause the struggle goes on even when you're not there
Blind and unaware

That's how we'll know, this is not a test, oh no
This is cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistakes
We're crashing into the ground as we all
Yeah, we all, all fall from grace


Were losing daylight but I can't work any faster.
Under the veil of dust we go on
Don't close your eyes.
What if it all disappears in the shadows?
Now reach for the stars

If I held my ground would you ask me to change
This drought bleeds on now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air but its still not the same
These worlds collide but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame and I know, I know

The waters come but the fire still rages on here
The men all shrugged their shoulders and left
We sleep so sound in rooms just up the stairs
Will you save us like you saved them?

If I held my ground would you ask me to change
This drought bleeds on now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air but its so not the same
These worlds collide but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame and I know, I know

You've bled me dry but I'm still breathing
I swear I'm sucking dry the sky
And you won't ever find us kneeling
Or swallowing your lies

If I held my ground would you ask me to change
This drought bleeds on now we're dancing for rain
We drink the air but its so not the same
These worlds collide but the distance remains
We point the finger, never accept the blame, and I know, I know

This drought bleeds on, this drought bleeds on


I never claimed to be something more than me,
Your standards are something that I refuse to see,
I will answer only to myself,
So why don't you police someone else

The place I call home isn't there anymore,
With boards on the windows and locks on the door,
So pick up the pieces that never once fit,
Let this be the end of it

Once you held a place for me,
But now that I've left you went and gave up my seat,
Don't expect me to share your visions of life,
I'll take the my chances somewhere else

The place I call home isn't there anymore,
With boards on the windows and locks on the door,
So pick up the pieces that never once fit,
Let this be the end of it

Give me the green light to get on with my life,
Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice

I live in exile of you, your key no longer fits,
Because the locks on my life are new


On dirt like stone
The life paste, the bones of men
That sought to overthrow
Or all that remains

Oh, what they stole
Was innocence, the slate once clean
Has gone as black as coal
Time and time again

Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
This world

No self-control
No sense of time
No bleeding hearts, no long good-byes
We grow colder every day

But is it all a show?
A game we play
Society vice queens, so fucking bored
And so cliche

Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive

Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now
Slow and steady now, it's time

Take a look around
The tide is turning upside down
The image of the world
Reflects inside the child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive

Around, take a look around
Watch this world reflect
Inside a child's eye
We eat our own to stay alive


The city grieves, like widows clasping
Folded flags against their hearts
Raindrops feel like dirt and roses
On black coffins in the dark

Not yet corpses, still we rot
Oblivious to our decay
Drinking poison drop by drop,
Destined to die

Unless we save our lives,
From the coming dawn,
That seeks to drown us in the flames
But if we sell our soul,
For the chance of gold,
Then we'll rue each passing day!

I swore this place was once was alive,
The streets all pulse like living veins,
Heart point beating crossed with blood,
The buildings breathe each time they sway

Time of dead,
Punctuated by the bells,
The sky turned red,
Then came the rain!

Come on lets
Save our lives,
From the coming dawn,
That seeks to drown us in the flames
But if we sell our soul,
For the chance of gold,
Then we'll rue each passing day!

Like fallen soldiers on these fields we
Spend our lives fighting truth upon the wheels
I swear we tried,
I gave up on this god forsaken sight,
And felt it all pass by!

Come on lets
Save our lives,
From the coming dawn,
That seeks to drown us in the flames
But if we sell our soul,
For the chance of gold,
Then we'll rue each passing day!

So save our,
(save our lives)
Our lives it's coming clear,
Yeah it's been coming clear,
(coming clear)
To me

We'll never sell our soul
(sell our soul)
For the chance of gold
And we'll live each passing day


Awake at the bottom
Of the barrels we cry out
So ashamed of our tears that
We blame only ourselves
That's when they win
They keep us convinced
To lift up our chins
These playing fields are level
We all have a chance
With that they dismiss
The fast lanes they row
What it takes, it depends on who you know
Or where you came from
Whose daughter are you?
Whose fortunate son?
Will it so
To stick up our bones
And piece from the letters
How we settled the crimes

Is this an over-reaching arm
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
(a just reparation)

Away from the towers
High above the ceiling tombs
Tell themselves
That they've earned this
Like working hard
Or playing by the rules
But this is only part true
A dangerous trick
Played on me and you
And so like a practical joke
We put on these bootstraps
So high that they broke

Is this an over-reaching arm
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?

And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
Will you fear these empty fairytales
Or will you believe them?

And if fear's a game
You better pray
That this sleeping giant never wakes

If we just take a step back
A bigger picture we might view
Perhaps the man in the gutter
Is not so different from you

Come in, all of the cold
Forget all that you know
Because there's always been room
By the fire for you, oh
Come in, all of the cold

Will you believe them?
Is this an over-reaching arm
Or is this compassion?
Is this a handout undeserved
Or a just reparation?
And like a single domino
That falls while the rest stay vertical
Will you fear these empty fairytales
Or will you believe them?


Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake?
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
There's a burden you've been bearing in spite of all your prayers
There's a light turned off inside your heart
Can you remember what it's like to care?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
But the memories that haunt us are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grey
And yet I fall, through these clouds, reaching, screaming

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

This grip loosens but it never breaks (NEVER BREAKS!)
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall (BREAK MY FALL!)
In them I find the comfort to see through it all
Guide me through unchartered waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass until forever?
Until forever ends!?
Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa


Deep inside these burning buildings
Voices die to be heard
Years we spent teaching a lesson
We ourselves had never learned

And if strength is born from heartbreak
Then mountains I could move
And if walls could speak I'd pray
That they would tell me what to do

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too.
Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Are what keep me coming back to you

No signs of life here, save the embers, the occasional flame
We know the way but can't remember, conception to the grave
Shout confessions from the greatest heights, where no one can hear
All my fears, my insecurities are falling like tears

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

The drones all slave away, they're working overtime
They serve a faceless queen, they never question why
Disciples of a God, they neither live nor breathe, (I won't come back)
But we have bills to pay, yeah we have mouths to feed! (I won't come back)
I won't come back!

And if you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
Failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

I'm coming back to you!


We don't sleep very much.
These triggers ache for the touch.
Where's the strength we relied on?
Here alone, like a crutch
Maybe that's what keeps us up
All the night with a light on

Howling screams simulate
Things that no longer take place
Can this be what we've become?
Paper-thin, overweight
Pills to arouse us in tape
Still we don't know what we want

We can let go
Can't you see?
To lose control
Is to be
Falling free

First a spark
Then a flame
Now a fire!

We explode!

Into the darkest of nights,
Disconnect,
Cut the cord,
Lights are dead.

Now they'll know,
With everything comes a price!

And each day we are torn
Between the right and the wrong
Between life and convenience,
While you sleep, I'll complain
It's always channels and chains
It's like elective amnesia.

As we grow older,
In this place,
It's just all over
Life's a race.

What they make.

First a spark,
Then a flame,
Now a fire

We explode!

Into the darkest of nights
Disconnect
Cut the cord
Lights are dead

Now they'll know
With everything comes a price!

It could be minutes away
It could be hours or days
Before the bottom falls out
Before the ground gets away
Into this debt we are born
A debt we try to repay
And yet we blacken the sky
Smoke rising out of the flames

Now they'll know

First a spark!
Then a flame!
Now a fire!

We explode!

Into the darkest of nights!
Disconnect!
Cut the cord!
Lights are dead!

Now they'll know
With everything comes a price!

We explode!
We explode!


And on that day they'll tell you
That life hung on with no clue
The warning signs were all just missed or shattered down
So it goes
The kings all failed to tell us
The madmen failed to sell us
Of what would then befall the only life we know

When they're burning signal fires
To guide us to the fields
We're building funeral pyres
They all commit a final appeal

The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
'Cause all the shoulders I wish to cry on gone

The paranoia gripped us
Berate and then consume us
The panic set in like a cancer to our hearts
Spreading through
We've been on fire like genius
I pray for god to save us
There was no answer, though
Disease tore us apart
We left bodies in the fields
So numb that we forgot how to feel

The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
'Cause all the shoulders I wish to cry on gone

He looked at the fields, and then his hands
All I need is what I have
Then fell a tear of happiness
Oh, she watched it all crumble away
Is this the end of yesterday?
"Lord, I hope so" is all he said
Gone are the cold cold wars
All I've got are the ?
And as we go forth
I pray we'll remember this day

Oh, we relied on now

The city lines are down
The kerosene's run out
The fact surreal
We relied upon
I shed this unclean skin
And start to feel again
With no more shoulders, shoulders to cry on now

No more, no more
No more, no more
No more, no more
The weight that we once felt is gone


All we are is entertainment
Caught up in our own derangement
Tell us what to say and what to do
All we are are pretty faces
Picture perfect bottled rage
Packaged synthesized versions of you

We've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
They all scream California and its toppling empire
Can't you see the end is coming soon

Come one come all the new sensation
Guarantees that obligations
Spotlights follow every single move
Basking here on ten-foot stages
Pouty lips and oh, so jaded
All as if we have something to prove

Despite these petty fortunes we still can't afford a life
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
They all scream California and its toppling empire
But can't you see the end is here

And if we cared at all
About this unknown plight
Then we'd do something more
To finally make this right

Is this only entertainment?
Pull the curtains, places please
We've learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
But this is more than entertainment
In a world so sick with pain
This is the only thing that's real or true

We've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
Confined to pull-out quotes and hotel rooms
They all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
But can't you see the end?


Under cover of the dark night  
Avoid the cloud of street lights  
And disappear at dawn

Camouflage ourselves again by  
Hiding here in plain sight  
Waiting for a sign to come  

Its the lottery of life  
We all play to just get by  
But some of us escaped  
We found a better way, a better life  

The ones that got away now  
Drifted from the herd  
Slipped through the fingers of your rule  
The ones that got away now  
Never to return  
We left your world and built our own  

And off the grid we're building  
Able but unwilling  
To bow to this design  

There is a light, there is a way out  
Safe before we all drown  
The boundaries have been redefined  

We are products of a place  
But our ties have been erased  
A wilderness awaits  
And lost in something we've been trying to find  

The ones that got away now  
Drifted from the herd  
Slipped through the fingers of your rule   
The ones that got away now  
Never to return  
We left your world, to build our own  

Give up our place  
In line to run so far away  
To break free from  
This endless race its never won  
This endless pace we can't outrun  

The blade spinning closer  
We keep our composure  

We are the ones that got away now  
Drifting from the herd  
We are the ones that got away now  
Never to return  

And from your clutches we're escaping  
Yeah from your grip, we are breaking free  

We got away  
Yeah, got away  
We got away  
Yeah 


In the face of change
Is when she turned to me and said
"I'm not sure anymore??

And there amidst the waves
And the cloudless skies
That blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something
That you thought would never end?
And then of course it did

Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin?
And then something had to give

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now that is all this is

With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
Always something in this everchanging life
And it probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now something has kept me here too long and you can't leave me if I'm already gone

Make the same mistakes we're always hanging on
Break the promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
Mow I keep this line open to get this call from you as you speak the words
That keep me coming back to you now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long and now I'm gone...


Wait
I'm not listening to you now
I wasn't listening to you then
I know that nothing will be the same again

There's only so much I can handle
Only so much I can take
Before my knees start to buckle
And my arms start to shake

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much of me you expect standing here right now
I beg for you to let go
I dread the day you finally do
I fight for your attention

Too little too late
Or too much too soon
And how will this plague the time
We share from here on out?
And how long will this taint
All these words spilling from my mouth?

Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?
I don't know how much more of me
You expect standing here right now
Have we been here before?
Will we be here again?


Keeping up appearances, don't break now
We're buckled from the weight
Pretend to laugh, but don't laugh too loud

Do you feel the pressure building?
The anger spilling out now
Meanwhile, the cracks have formed on the masks we've worn up 'til now

We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art
Works of art

Pieces of our hearts are gravitating together but
Before we could be part of this mosaic

We had to break apart like glass
We're falling faster than stars
Meanwhile, the cracks have formed on the masks we've worn up 'til now

Take a look
We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art

With every color, we shine!
A tapestry of scars!
Without regret we're
Growing stronger and moving onward
Finding right ways, despite the wrong ones
We're clearing paths, we're locked by storms
We're finding the beauty
In what you've ignored

We are far from perfect
But perfect as we are
We are far from perfect
We're perfect as we are
We are bruised, we are broken
But we are goddamn works of art
Yeah, we are perfect as we are
Perfect as we are


Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts and let the rest remain

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't wanna be dead

Someday we'll all be rich
Someday I won't listen to you bitch
I'll turn up the volume so you can hear all the shit we play just for you

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please, I don't wanna be dead

Someday I'll feel no pain
Someday I won't have a brain
They'll take away the part that hurts and let the rest remain

Fix me
Fix my head
Fix me please
I don't wanna be dead so fix it


There's something happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop, listen, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

There's battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

I think it's time we stop, listen, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

What a field-day for the heat
A thousand people in the street
Singing songs and carrying signs
Mostly say, hooray for our side

Now you better stop, listen, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

Now you better stop, listen, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down
Stop, children, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going...
better Stop, now, what's that sound
Everybody look what's going down


We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
And we don't disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me

Love, loss
Like a bullet's path
Tear through
The cavity of my chest
Lights out
Because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day it began
'Cause it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that's how we

Read you
Like a polygraph
Not one
Single bone in your back
Own up
To how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone's the same, we know, we know, we know, we know
But if to live, we have to be numb
I'd rather know the pain, I'd rather know, I'd rather know
This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be the same
The ends we seam together

I'm not after fame and fortune
I'm after you
When I've served my time I swear I
Will come back for you

(Watch them fall)
As their castles crumble slowly
We watch them fall
Their crown slips from heads unworthy
And right onto us

But, I'm after you
I'm after you
I'm after you
Yeah, I'm after you.


Getting trampled under boots of progress
Ignore the pleading of the nameless faces
Now with our backs against the wall
How long 'til we fall?

Do away with all the underprivileged
Their demographic doesn't fit your image
Turn your blind eye when duty calls
How long 'til we fall?

(In with the new)
This is something that you can't ignore
A simple thing worth fighting for
'Cause now they're tearing down our doors

So she screams out the window
"I've had it up to here"
So sick and tired of wondering
Where I'll be next year'

Caring less about the homeless millions
All the petty problems that go with them
Reap the profit that reaps their lives and
Tell me that it's fine

Throw them out and call it relocation
Lower-income-housing quick solution
A generation lost

Now in the whirlwind of my life
Is where you presently reside
Can I pretend you don't exist
Maybe just for ten more minutes?

My hearts been broken into two
And rusted from years of disuse
So will you place upon it your hands
Will you help it beat again?

It seems the whole world's turned on me
(Bound and gagged) in the land of the free
Let's talk this over, this game is over

In with the new, out with the old
Hearts of the world have grown so cold
Let's talk this over, this game is over


It was the perfect night
Then you had to go and ruin it with a kiss now
I'm trapped inside here
The innocence we held once so carelessly has been suffocated in this breathless moment

Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

With arms raised to the stars begging them to listen
With legs littered with scars cut from these olive branches
Now, point of return now crossed and our hands left shaking
Tonight we give in to temptation

Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

Someone stop my mind from screaming
It's so loud I can't hear myself think
Life, death, religion, survival
It makes no sense
Don't try to tell me that I'm a coincidence

Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

Believe in me and I will believe in you
You're asking of me everything
So I'll give it all to you

If I never have you, then I can never lose you
Now, everything here is a lie
Where is the truth?
Where is the fucking truth?


Break through the undertow,
Your hands I can't seem to find,
Pollution burns my tongue,
Cough the words I can't speak so I stall myself again, then I fall to the surface,
Fill my lungs with air,
Then let it out

I give it all,
This is the reason that I sing,
So give it all,
Cause it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottoms where we live,
And still we dig these trenches,
Bury ourselves in them,
Backs breaking on the tension

For far too long these voices,
Muffled by distances,
It's time to come to our senses,
And from the dark

We give it all,
This is the reason why I sing,
So give it all,
It's these reasons that belong to me

Breathe, the air we give,
The life we live,
Our voices raising distances,
So when my tongue,
Break into song,
You seize a competition,

So please believe your eyes,
Of sacrifice,
Is not what we had in our minds,
I'm coming home tonight, home tonight

We give it all,
This is the reason why I sing,
So give it all,
It's these reasons that belong to me

Today I offer myself up to this I'm living for my dying wish,
I give it all,
Now there's a reason, there's a reason,
To give it all


We celebrate the downfall with ticker tape parades
Oblivious to the fucking mess left lying in the wake
"God grant me the strength to let my children starve"
He whispered to the dripping roof into the candled dark

Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
We bury ten thousand stories untold

Flirt with insurrection batting eyes from afar
In skybox seats or hotel suites, six figure fucking cars

Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
Bury the stories

Control the heart
Control the mind
Control the hands

To build what they've designed
Lifetimes of silence and apathy
Ensure the prompt demise of our humanity

Contemplate contracts of gold
Just wave your hand and relinquish control
Nine lives await to unfold
We bury ten thousand stories untold
The stories untold


Buried words
Under lights
Soundtrack to this stagnant life
This meaning lost in translation
Message sucked out of his hands again

This could be my great awakening
But how would I know
'Cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
Staring at the empty stares
Realize that he no longer cares about the wrong or right
The downward spiral begins tonight

And this could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?
This could be my great awakening
But how would I know 'cause it's all noise to me
(Nothing I can do will make you hear)


A sinking ship, an awkward kiss
A chance to set things straight
The kind of hurt that burns and burns
Like fires we can't contain

We hole up in a shelter made of bones and ice and there we'll wait
So start again with steady hands
This time nothing gets in our way
But as we peer a little closer what do we see?

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

A promise kept
The dirt unswept
A poorly worn disguise
A child unloved that then grows up
To love what we despise

We're broken but still breathing
We are wounded but we are healing
We pick up right where we left off
Breathe on the ashes that remain

So that these coals may become fire
To guide our way

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

I walk on wounds
That seldom prove to slow me down
I laugh this constant pain away
So you can't tell
But there it lies under the smiles
It drains me mile after mile
But seldom proves to slow me down
Here I go
Here I go
Here I go

Should we just hold on
To what remains of
What we thought was lost

But it's just

A crack in the surface
A flaw in the plan
(Plans we made together, almost buried in the sand)
A cadence imperfect
Like a building condemned
(Can we indemnify ourselves if we don't face what we're against)

A crack in the surface
a crack in the surface.


Is this the point where we give up?
Is this the point where we give in?
Is this the point where we turn ourselves in?

Is this the time to ask questions?
Is this the time to seek answers?
Is this the time to throw it all in?

When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
You're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there

This is the point where we stand up
This is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free

When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there

Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end,
The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend,
Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reason


The day I learn to fly, I'm never coming down
On perfect wings I'll rise through the layers of the clouds

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
And six million people that keep their fires lit

I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place, fuck you

I see myself inside, you dream the dreams that I do
You're still searching for these answers, they're not inside your wrist

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
And six million people that keep their fires lit

I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place, fuck you

I close my eyes as the curtains draw
I thought I heard your voice but I thought wrong
'Cause you're not there anymore
No you're not there anymore

And so I lift my chin and the show goes on
The sky is listening, the stars all sing along
But you're not there anymore
And I just can't care anymore


I have my mother's dreams
I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try

The crescent city sleeps
While giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash
Let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us?
Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning
The cypress has died

And all along they're saying

Help is on the way (They said they said)
Help is on the way (They said they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Five thousand feet below
As black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes
Eleven mothers cry

My bones all resonate
A burning lullaby
You can't take that from me
Just go ahead and try

She says that's a shoreline
With hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night
Does anyone care?
And all along can say it

Help is on the way (They said they said)
Help is on the way (They said they said)
Hold my hand, to help see, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Right here
Right here

Right here
Right here

Right here
Right here

Choking on the black gold
Upon which we here rely
We keep axes in the attic
To see cameras in the sky

Help is on the way (They said they said)
Help is on the way (They said they said)

We were told, just to sit tight
'Cause somebody will soon arrive

Help is on the way
They never came
They never came

Help is on the way (They said they said)
Help is on the way (They said they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

On the way


He said son, have you seen the world?
Well, what would you say if I said that you could
Just carry this gun, you'll even get paid
I said that sounds pretty good

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends

They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again

A hero of war
Yeah that's what I'll be
And when I come home
They'll be damn proud of me
I'll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Cause it's a flag that I love
And a flag that I trust

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away

And the shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow

A hero of war
Is that what they see?
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it's a flag that I love
The only flag that I trust

He said, son, have you seen the world?
Well what would you say, if I said that you could?


Even though we know, yeah we know
Our time has almost come, we're all overdue
Can there be a place to call our own?
Can there be a road that takes us home?

We toe the line
We go along
We don't belong
To you now

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leaves
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets

But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours

The mystery unknown
Now unfolds
The life that we once owned
First bought, then sold

Like messengers of war
We've no control
To oceans unexplored
This ship sails through

We toe the line
We go along
We don't belong
To you now

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leafs
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets

But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours, it pours, it pours

When it rains it pours
When they die, we mourn
When it hit, we swore
Now we want not more

Like a saint reborn
Like a rose in a storm
Like a child unborn
A child unborn

It's the coin
We're tossing into the well
It's misfortune that
We could not foretell
It's the dry spell

When it rains it pours
Like summer storms
The skies as gray as leafs
The rivers flood the banks
And spill into the streets

But the people laughed
And swore that they'd restore
The city piece by piece
And then the clouds gave
Way as if to agree
When it rains it pours, it pours
When it rains it pours


I can see the storms in her eyes now
I'm falling overboard in the waves
In over my head and she's a high tide
That keeps pushing me away
I thought that we would build this together
But everything I touch just seems to break
Am I your sail or your anchor?
Am I the calm or the hurricane?

I feel the ground start to shake
I hear a voice shouting "No"
But there is no fucking way
I'd leave you

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now, oh oh
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you, oh oh

But is the soundtrack to our lives
The bang of a slamming door
What happens when we all start to feel like
Nothing matters anymore
Every day like a chambered round, a trigger pulled
A hammer click, a breath we hold
A world outside I can't control
No matter what I do

So I'll just hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now, oh oh
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you, oh oh

How is it a thing
That we just wanna hurt each other
I'm waiting out the rain
'Cause life is gonna rain forever
Someday you will learn
That all I ever did was for you
And I would do it all again
I would do it all again

'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade
You touch me like a razor blade
I wish there was some other way right now, oh oh
Like a house on fire we're up in flames
I'd burn here if that's what it takes
To let you know I won't let go of you, oh oh

Of you (oh oh)
Of you (oh oh)
Of you (oh oh)
Of you


How many walls can you put up?
How many guns 'til you feel safe?
How many times can we watch this story over, and over, and over again?
And how many years have we wasted counting the lies that we've been fed?
There's something to change
We have waited over, and over, and over again

I'm entertained by the monkey on your back
Can we still call it a joke if no one laughs?
It's either going up in smoke around me, or according to plan
A bittersweet disaster melting over, and over again

How many walls can you put up?
How many guns 'til you feel safe?
How many times can we watch this story over, and over, and over again?
How many years have we wasted counting the lies that we've been fed?
There's something to change
We have waited over, and over, and over again

Chasing our own tail
The more we learn, the less we know
As the monsters lost in history
Are now acting very tough
As we bow down
Roll up the carpet, red as rose
We should have known

How many walls can you put up?
How many guns 'til you feel safe?
How many times can we watch this story over, and over, and over again?
How many years have we wasted counting the lies that we've been fed?
There's something to change, we have waited
Over, and over, and over, and over again

How many walls?
And how many guns?
How many times?
Over, and over, and over again
Over, and over, and over again

And how many lives have been wasted?
How many bodies laid to rest?
Sick of the lies, the same old stories
Over, and over, and over, and over
Over, and over, and over, and over
Again!


On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scratching lines on the wall
Wait in the wings at someone's back and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere this fate, I lost control

We backed down, we took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around

I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn
And I don't want to be here anymore

On hand and foot we answered every single call
Weathered every day like passing storms
But when we break we will all be gone

Won't back down, won't take no for answers anymore
These walls close, we pace back and forth

I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
I don't want to be here anymore

The point where we break is closer everyday
But where do we go? But where do we go?

I don't want to be here anymore
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured, whoa whoa
See I don't think I can fight this anymore,
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn
And I don't want to be here anymore
Anymore


You spend your days counting the hours you're awake
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
It's a burden you've been burying in spite of all your prayers
As the light turns off inside your heart do you remember
What it's like to care

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

Give me the drug, keep me alive, give me whats left of my life
Don't let me go

Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
With the memories that haunt us, I cherish just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grave

Yet I fall through these clouds and she's screaming

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me whats left of my life
Don't let me go

Pull this plug, let me breath
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go

This grip loosens but it never breaks
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall
And now I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass
Until forever, until forever ends

Knees are weak, hands are shaking
I can't breathe

Give me the drug,keep me alive
Give me whats left of my life
Don't let me go

Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own I'm finally free
Don't let me go (Repeatx3)


This is noise

Down beyond these city streets
Through gutters filled with black debris
In alleys void of any light
Where nameless things live out of sight

Down through the scrapers of the sky
Past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car
Are you happy where you are?

Blind to this impending fate
We let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine, let's go

And so we carry on each day
As if our lives are not so gray
While every breath that we take
We only suffocate

Brush past a myriad
Of scenes a homeless vet crashed on wall street
A single mom of three
A TV personality

Blind to this impending fate
We let the world carry our weight
It's back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine

Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us, from what we have become tonight
Eyes, glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours and yours is mine


Wrapped up in a short black coat worn thin
A hand around her match to block the wind.
She smiled as the smoke escaped her lips
Then let her hand fall gently away from this.

Cause it's late now, and I'm tired of all these games
And the cold night stings my skin.
I won't say it now, but I get closer everyday to letting this world win

And the city chokes on everything it makes
But the sunrise heals every heart it breaks.
And not unlike the birds, we all sing songs
To celebrate, to mourn, or just hang on

Cause it's late now, and the day has not been kind
So I came here to forget
It's a hard town, but I hold my head up high
Like a death row cigarette

Cant this all wait 'til the morning
I can't think straight right now
Seems like we're better off without these clenched fists
All boxing us in, I want out, I want out

Like Christmas lights left up 'till mid-July
We kept alive something that should have died
And everyday another light burns out
'till on this street we are the darkest house

Cause it's late now, and everybody's left
And I think I might too
Like my mother said, you always leave with who you bring
And I came here with you


With your eyes glazed and half-smile
Explain to me the details of your God-given right
You point your finger in my face
But you can't remember what you did last night

It's all fun and games ?til you try to justify
It's all fun and done ?til you question the choices in your life

Join all the millions of victims who prescribe to this mediocre life
And all these years have been lost looking for something that you'll never find

It's all fun and games ?til you try to justify
It's all fun and done ?til you question the choices in your life


There, high on the watchtower
Keeping the peace
Whatever that means
'Cause you see the world through
Cross hairs and TVs don't you

Ten foot walls built around us
White picket death
So quiet, so safe
If we fall there'll be nothing
No one to catch us
Sit back and watch as we

Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover, but collide with each other
We spin out of control

Something I can't change
I was born in a place
That lives by the sword
And thus to it's blade we're condemned
Don't you understand why
We scream "no more" (no more)

My dreams are of children
Orphaned by blood
Spilled at these hands
And here on the graves
Of the innocent
We raise our flag

Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover, but collide with each other
We spin out of control

Some things you don't forgive some things you don't forget
Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death
We're way off course now and we're drifting off to sea
So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free

Spin out of control
Spin out of control
Try to recover, but collide with each other
We spin out of control


This night will fall like any other
Daylight subsides and shadows crawl out from under 
That corner's hiding something stirs
Oh so restless, cracked windows opened wide
Deadbolt turns, doors creak open
Whispers and moonlight there to guide

Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens round our flame
While the world sleeps we are awake

The black bird calls, it sings a chorus
While the gathering swells 
The flames built tall right before us 
As drums keep pounding
And the masses now are fusing 
Bodies pressed and tangled
As we revel in confusion our inhibitions thrown into the fire

Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens round our flame
While the world sleeps we are awake

Here in the dark we are safe from the judgment
And now arm in arm, locked tight so no one gets in
The Heaven-sent say, \"Child you are Hellbent\"
But Hell is not where we're going
Hell's where we've been

Come raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flame
And while the world sleeps we are awake

Raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flames
While the world sleeps we are awake

(Raise your lantern to the sky)
Yeah we are alone
We are awake
(Raise your lantern to the sky)
Yeah we are the light
We are the way

Suffering from something we're not sure of
In a world there is no cure for
These lives we live test negative for happiness
Flat line, no pulse, but eyes open
Single file like soldiers on a mission
If there's no war outside our heads
Why are we losing?

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening, a life less frightening

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening, a life less frightening

Hang me out to dry I'm soaking
With the sense of knowing
What's gone wrong but doing nothing I still run
Time again I have found myself stuttering
Foundations pulled out from under me
This breath is wasted on them all
Will someone answer me

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening, a life less frightening

Is there a God tonight?
Up in the sky or is it empty just like me (Just like me)
A place where we can hide out from the night
Where you are all I need (Where you are all I need)
So all he says, goodbye, and close your eyes
Tell me what you say (Tell me what you say)
A life I sit inside this dream of mine
Where you are all I see

I don't ask for much
Truth be told I'd settle
For a life less frightening, a life less frightening


They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold

The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
And everything you touch turns into gold

Like the angel you are
You laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me (Your answer's always maybe)
That's when I got up and left

A beating heart and a microphone
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago
Even though I've come so far 
I know I've got so far to go 
And any day now I'll explode

Like the angel you are
You laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me (Your answer's always maybe)
That's when I got up and left

And each and everyday, will lead into tomorrow
Tomorrow brings one less day without you
But don't wait up just leave the light on
'Cause all the roads that I might take 
Will all one day lead back to you

And like the angel you are
You laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me (Your answer's always maybe)
That's when I got up and left


Little boxes on the hillside,
Little boxes made of ticky tacky,
Little boxes on the hillside,
Little boxes all the same.
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one,
And they're all made out of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same.

And the people in the houses
All went to the university,
Where they were put in boxes
And they came out all the same,
And there's doctors and lawyers,
And business executives,
And they're all made out of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same.

And they all play on the golf course
And drink their martinis dry,
And they all have pretty children
And the children go to school.
And the children go to summer camp
And then to the university,
Where they are put in boxes
And they come out all the same.

And the boys go into business
And marry and raise a family
In boxes made of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same.
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one.
And they're all made out of ticky tacky
And they all look just the same.


Far from home on a road unknown
Where the vultures circle on winds that blow
From northern skies that haunt these waking moments
Our shadows cast by the mountain range
Our calloused souls, we find a way
Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon
While this sun is rising, yeah

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
And we are alone under this sun
And we work to fix the work that you've undone

When cries for help go unanswered
And signal fires just burn and burn
We wonder if we're waiting here for nothing
'Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
With the constant drone of the unfulfilled
But we'll never fall if we stand for something
We stand for something, yeah

Yeah, we are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
And we are alone under this sun
And we work to fix the work that you've undone

Don't fall, I see lights in the distance
They're not far away
Stand up cause the sky is turning gray
There's hope in these footsteps of persistence
So don't go astray
These lights get closer every day

'Cause we are the long forgotten sons
Yeah we are the long forgotten sons
We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
And we are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone
What you've undone


Whoa, whoa.

Bang bang go the coffin nails, like a breath exhaled,
Then gone forever.
It seems like just yesterday, how did I miss the red flags raise?

Think back to the days we laughed.
We braved these bitter storms together.
Then brought to his knees he cried,
But on his feet he died.

What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?

What God could make it stop?
Let this end.
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge.
It's come to this,
A weightless step.
On the way down singing,
Whoa, whoa.

Bang bang from the closet walls,
The schoolhouse halls,
The shotgun's loaded.
Push me and I'll push back.
I'm done asking, I demand.

From a nation under God,
I feel it's love like a cattle prod.
Born free, but still they hate.
A born me, no I can't change

It's always darkest just before the dawn.
So stay awake with me, let's prove them wrong.

Make it stop.
Let this end,
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge.
It's come to this,
A weightless step.
On the way down singing
Whoa, whoa.

The cold river washed him away,
But how could we forget.
The gatherings hold candles, but not their tongues.

And too much blood has flown from the wrist,
Of the children shamed for those they chose to kiss.
Who will rise to stop the blood.
We're calling for,
Insisting on, a different beat, yeah.
A brand new song, whoa, oh
A brand new song, whoa, whoa, whoa

(Whoa) Make it stop.
Let this end,
This life chose me, I'm not lost in sin
(Whoa) And proud I stand, of who I am,
I plan to go on living

(Whoa) Make it stop.
Let this end,
All these years pushed to the ledge
(Whoa) But proud I stand, of who I am,
I plan to go on living


This time, this time, making Christmas, making Christmas
Making Christmas, making Christmas, making Christmas is so fine
It's ours this time and won't the children be surprised?
It's ours this time

Making Christmas, making Christmas, making Christmas
Time to give them something fun
They'll talk about for years to come
Let's have a cheer from everyone, it's time to party

Making Christmas, making Christmas
Snakes and mice get wrapped up so nice
With spider legs and pretty bows
It's ours this time

All together that and this
With all are tricks we're making Christmastime, here comes Jack
I don't believe what's happening to me
My hopes, my dreams, my fantasies

Won't they be impressed, I am a genius?
See how I transformed this old rat into a most delightful hat
My compliments from me to you on this your most intriguing hat
Consider thought this substitute, a bat in place of this old rat

No, no, no, now that's all wrong
This thing will never make a present
It's been dead for much too long
Try something fresher, something pleasant
Try again, don't give up

All together, this and that
With all our tricks we're making Christmastime

This time, this time, making Christmas, making Christmas
La, la, la, it's almost here and we can't wait
So ring the bells and celebrate 'cause when the full moon starts to climb
We'll all sing out it's Christmastime


Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa

Stick to your guns, they fail to protect
I've seen this before and we died in the end
Lept without looking we land in the flames
We don't even care anymore
We're tired of being ignored

Speak up now
Yeah, we're not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Think out loud
What are you waiting for?
Clear your god damn throat
You are the megaphone
Don't wait (don't wait)
Or turn away (turn away)
Don't choke on words you meant to say
Speak up now you are not alone
This ain't a fucking joke
Pick up the megaphone
Yell "hey!"

Say something, anything to me
Or can you feel something, anything for me?
'Cause it's not enough to wait for the storm
To relent and give up

Speak up now
You are not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Think out loud
What are you waiting for?
Clear your god damn throat
You are the megaphone
Don't wait (don't wait)
Or turn away (turn away)
Or choke on words you meant to say
Speak up now you are not alone
This is not a joke
Pick up the megaphone
Yell "hey!"

Whoa, Whoa
Whoa, Whoa

Say something, anything to me
Feel something, anything for me
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Say something, Say something
Now speak up
You are not alone
You are the megaphone
Now speak up
You are not alone
You are the megaphone
Yell "hey!"


Love's like a needle full of methadone.
Potent but not real, left you wanting more.

Lipstick, track marks, bleeding red.
Like Montagues and Capulets.
For us child, the stars refuse to shine.
Oh why for us child, do the stars refuse to shine?

Somewhere strung out on the lam.
We wound up back here again.
Like unstable chemicals,
Combining only to explode.

What would it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire.
And all the world's a fuse,
So don't get close.
The trouble and the worth
Am I better off on my own?

Contaminated, quarantined, then left alone.
A shipment refused, address unknown.
Damaged goods they soon forget.
In choking dust where we got left.
For us all, the stars refuse to shine.

Tap the vein and light the match
We burn like stars before the crash
But for you there's still a chance
Just let go

What would it take for you to notice?
I am a heart on fire.
And all the world's a fuse,
So don't get close
Trouble and the worth
I'm better off on my own
On my own

Now there's nowhere to run
And yeah there's nowhere to hide
There's nothing under the sun
We haven't already tried

What will it take for you to notice?
I am a hand grenade, pin already pulled so don't let go
As we chase the sun, my shadow slows us down.
And without me along, you're better off and I know
You're better off and I know
And I know


Like a new day rising, like a calm before the storm
Like fog lifting from valleys on a sleeping forest floor
Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaken off
To gaze upon the wreckage that the midnight hands have brought.
And now I

I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,

I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,

Whatever path you take, wherever you might go,
Whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow.

We face a crossroad never knowing what's in store.
There's an angel on my shoulder,
There's a devil at my door

She proclaimed tonight will be the greatest of our lives
And I said don't be so sure let's just wait until the morning light.

I feel my temperature rising.
My body explodes.
I feel like somebody's watching, like I'm not alone,

I stopped I
Vowed right then and said that,

Whatever path you take, wherever you might go,
Whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow.

There in the clearing, we gathered close
Under the moon's pale light we laid out the tools.
"And you don't have to do this, and I'd forgive you if you don't"
But she just looked away and said "I know"

Gripped by the midnight hands We dream of futures that would prevent
Gripped by the midnight hands

The line's crossed over
The dawn grows closer
Let's bite off too much
Let's jump with a blind trust
In water over our head

And whatever path you take, and wherever you might go,
And whenever you decide to leave,
I will follow, I will follow, I will

Bear all falls you take, I won't let go if you decided to stray
I'll be there until you don't wake up, yeah, I will follow, I will follow

I will follow
(whatever path you take)
I will follow
(wherever you might go, I will follow)
I will follow
(whenever you decide to leave)
I will follow.


We're not the first, I hope we're not the last
'Cause I know we're all ready for that adult crash
The time is so little, the time belongs to us
Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?

Take your time
And Try not to forget
We never will
We're just a minor threat

We're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat

Early to finish, I was late to start
I might be an adult, but I'm a minor at heart
Go to college, be a man, what's the fucking deal?
It's now how old I am, it's how old I feel

Make do with what you have
Take what you can get
Pay no mind to us
We're just a minor threat

We're just a minor threat
Yeah we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat
So we're just a minor threat

Fuck yeah!


We scan the empty sky
Always without success
We're lighting signal fires
And spelling "SOS"
We stare at broken clocks
The truth comes twice a day
While every second just slips away

Are you gonna wait here for a sign to let you know now?
Are you gonna to sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?
Or are you gonna finally grip the wheel? I think you know how
This is more than you expected it to be

Don't wait for a miracle
To tumble from the sky
To part the seas around you
Or turn water into wine
Don't wait for a miracle
The world is passing by
The walls, that will surround you
Are only in your mind

The stage is set
And the curtains pulled
Ready or not, it's time, on with the show
And now the crowds have grown impatient
And the train has left the station
And the candles you are lighting in the dark will fade away

So what what are you waiting for, a sign to let you know now?
Are you going to sit there paralyzed by what you've seen?
Or are you gonna finally grip the wheel? I think you know how
Are you gonna throw it all away?

Don't wait for a miracle
To tumble from the sky
To part the seas around you
Or turn water into wine
Don't wait for a miracle
The world is passing by
The walls, that will surround you
Are only in your mind

When the weights we carry breaks us, we're tempted to stay down
But every road to recovery starts at the breakdown

But we don't need miracles
To tumble from the sky
To part the seas around us
Or turn water into wine
'Cause we are the miracles
We happen all the time
We're not scared of what surrounds us
We're not waiting for a sign

We are the miracles
We are the miracles
We are the miracles
Hey!


Mother 
Tell your children not to walk my way 
Tell your children not to hear my words 
What they mean 
What they say 
Mother 

Mother 
Can you keep them in the dark for life 
Can you hide them from the waiting world 
Oh mother 

Father 
Gonna take you daughter out tonight 
Gonna show her my world 
Oh father 

Not about to see your light 
But if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till your bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's 

Mother 
Tell your children not to hold my hand 
Tell your children not to understand 
Oh mother 

Father 
Do you wanna bang heads with me 
Do you wanna feel everything 
Oh father 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till your bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's 
Yea 

Not about to see your light 
But if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Till your bleeding 

Not about to see your light 
And if you wanna find hell with me 
I can show you what it's like 
Mother 
Yeah


Stand by to switch on
We fire out all pistons
We're singing along
But no one is listening
From dusk until dawn
We stay up to carry the flame
And when it's all said and done
In these alternate endings
When nothing is love
But the stragglers and empties
We're sleeping it off
Just to wake up and start it again

So burn the statues to the ground
Start to lay your weapons down
Bound for glory on this street
But there's a bridge up overhead
Noise cancel, drown the signal out
Change channels, manufactured doubt
When the only thing we'll fight for every day
Is a better seat on a crashing...
Plain to see, but hard to breathe
The streets are full of tumbleweeds

And now it's morning in the streets of Amerika
But we don't go outside anymore
The radio blasts hysteria
While the television's sideways on the floor

Under moonlit skies and surveillance
As we cheer from the stands in the stadiums
On a jumbotron we all sing along to escape
Once we were the lighthouse
To the world's most desperate ships
But what we became was a towering flame
Leading the moth right into it
Now we are waking up to the phone lines cut

'Cause it's morning in the streets of Amerika
And we don't go outside anymore
The radio blasts hysteria
While the television's sideways on the floor

With a teleprompter in our faces
Yeah, we don't even know what we're saying
Car that's slowly crashing
And we can't look away
Parading to the edge of the cliff now
We're trying to figure out how to get down
While the night is fast approaching
Would we even recognize our former lives in this artificial light?

Morning in the streets of Amerika
But we don't go outside anymore
There's something wrong with the stereo
And the television's sideways
We're mourning in the streets of Amerika
Mourning in the streets of Amerika
We're mourning in the streets of Amerika
Mourning in the streets of Amerika


Fighting back the impulse
Turn my head and close my eyes
Spending these nights awake and cold and paralyzed
Wonder how we got this far and
Never realized 
The common thread that binds our lives
And I know you hurt
And I can help you if you can

Take my hand
And we'll live inside the dreams we left behind
Take my hand
As we move from this place to a better life
Take my hand, whoa oh oh
(If you take my hand)

Fighting back the feeling that you always could deny
Anything but everything we know is just a lie
As I cremate this memory and watch the darkened ashes rise
And beneath the smoke
I'll stand and ask you if you can

Take my hand
And I'll promise not to ever let it go
Take my hand
'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know
(Take my hand)
And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show

Fight back the urges
Turn my head and close my eyes
And will I wake tomorrow still alive

I'm still dreaming
I'm still waiting
I'm still sure
(I'm still sure)
You're still living in a life
That isn't yours
(That isn't yours)
And this is part of me
I hope you never see
This is my life inside your heart

Take my hand
And I'll promise not to ever let it go
Take my hand
'Cause this hope is greater than you'll ever know
(Take my hand)
And this is all I'll ever ask of you to show


I'm about to have a nervous breakdown
My head really hurts
If I don't find a way out of here
I'm gonna go berserk cause
I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
It's going... berserk
I hear the same old talk talk talk
The same old lines
Don't do me that today
Yeah If you know what's good for you you'll get out of my way
Cause I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders
Going... berserk
I won't apologize
For acting outta line
You see the way I am
You leave any time you can cause
I'm crazy and I'm hurt
Head on my shoulders Going... berserk
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!
I don't care what you fuckin' do
I don't care what you fuckin' say
I'm so sick of everything I just want to...die!


To all you people standing proud, thinking you know what I'm about, I think you can fuck yourself
(Let's go!)
From your safe distance in this crowd
That's when your voice becomes so loud
Still trying to keep us down

Walk one mile in shoes I never asked to fill 
But still I press on?.

I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.

Give me one reason to look you in the eye
(Just one!)
Tell me exactly why it is that you think you are worth my time

I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything.
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.

To all the ones that shake my hand
Then talk your shit behind my back
To those who claim they understand
But never heard a word I said
In spite of you, I am still here
This vision has never been more clear
As we sing together now.

(Now that's when!)
I slipped, I fell, then I lost everything
My hope, my faith, in what the future brings
In hopes of pushing past the tie that brings us down 
We sing together now.


One last thing I beg you please just before you go
I've watched you fly on paper wings half way round the world
Until they burned up in the atmosphere and sent you spiraling down
Landed somewhere far from here with no one else around
To catch you falling down
And I'm looking at you now

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I

Swing for the fences son
He must have told you once
That was a conversation you took nothing from
So raise your glass now and celebrate exactly what you've done
Just put off another day of knowing where your from
You can catch up with yourself if you run

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I

Is this the life that you lead?
Or the life that's left for you?
Will you take the road that's been laid out before you
Will we cross paths somewhere else tonight? Somewhere else

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I

And I can't tell if you're laughing
Between each smile there's a tear in your eye
There's a train leaving town in an hour
Its not waiting for you and neither am I


There's something wrong with the words that we're not sayin'
And the silence we're creatin'
Like a ghost note symphony
There's something wrong and the temperature is risin'
Ignoring every siren
As we're marching towards the cliff

But these are choices that we don't have to make
Block out the voices
'Cause they have led you astray
What I've been trying to say to you is that

There's something in the water
There must be something in the air
Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it
It doesn't mean that - that it's not there

Yeah, we are all turned on
But then we all tuned out
As we are hypnotized by the sparkling lies
We fall under their spell

But don't forget that these are choices (choices)
That we don't have to make
So many voices (voices)
That have led us astray
We can't keep anything down
The room is spinning around

There must be something in the water
Yeah, there's something in the air
Just 'cause I can't put my finger on it
It doesn't mean that - that it's not there

You are the grains of sand
That slip through my hands again
And we are the hourglass
Love like a flame that can't be held
Somewhere beyond the lives we burn
Lies the point of no return
Like the sand within an hourglass

But there is something odd!
But there is something odd!

But there is something in your eyes
That shakes me back to life
And though I can't put my finger on it
Now I know we're gonna be alright!

It's gonna be alright!
It's gonna be alright!

'Cause there is something in the water
Yeah, there is something in the water

In this life
We sink or swim or just float
We all die
Yeah, but did we live at all?


My God is better than yours
And the walls of my house are so thick
I hear nothing at all

I followed you out in the storm
But it carried you off
And I burned every picture of yours
Was that not enough?

My gun is bigger than yours
So let's arm the masses
And see what the bastards do then
Walking tall once set us apart
Now we're down on all fours
Do you cry my name in the dark
Like I do yours?

These storms are getting stronger now
Trusses all bend and sway
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray
As the waves crash high
And the shoreline disappears
I will scream to the sky
"Hey, people live here."

My dreams are not unlike yours
They long for the safety
And break like a glass chandelier
But there's laughter and oh there is love
Just past the edge of our fears
And there's chaos when push comes to shove
But it's music to my ears

May you be in Heaven before the Devil knows you're dead
May these winds be always at your back

'Cause when we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
We will look at the ashes
And say, People lived here

From the penthouse to the holy martyr
Sea to shining sea
From the coffins full of kindergartners
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses
Are your hands so clean?

And the wildfire and it's spreading far
From sea to shining sea

When we're all just ghosts
And the madness overtakes us
I will scream to the sky, yeah I'll scream to the sky
Yeah I'll scream to the sky
Hey, people live here


I hear your voice in the wind
It follows me, it cuts right through the noise
As we spin on dance floors made of ice
So rest your hand in mine
Steady now, ignore the sound
Of breaking lines
The crack beneath our feet as time runs out

Each night like a white noise frequency
Broadcast the waves, I tune them out
Clear signs outlined, but I couldn't see
What I see now

I should've said something to you
When I saw you walk away
Instead, I did nothing
And now
You're gone and it's too late
So we board up the windows we used to look through
I should've said something
Yeah, I should've said something to you

Like buried seeds in the ground
Invisible, but growing underneath
Pushing out
Now tangled in the vine, I hear the sound

Heartbeats from a world so far away
The distant drums, I tune them out
Each night before I fall asleep
I hear them loud

I should've said something to you
When I saw you walk away
Instead, I did nothing
And now
You're gone and it's too late
So we board up the windows we used to look through
I should've said something
Yeah, I should've said something to you

Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh

I should've said something
Yeah, I should've said something
So we board up the windows we used to look through
I should've said something
I should've said something
I should've said something
Yeah, I should've said something to you
To you


Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew

Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told

But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way

Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed

Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!

Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!


To the sound of a heartbeat pounding away
To the rhythm of the awful rusted machines
We toss and turn but don't sleep
Each breath we take makes us thieves
Like causes without rebels
Just talk but promise nothing else

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
But sometimes dreams just don't come true
We wait to reap what we are due

To the rhythm of a time bomb ticking away
And the blare of the sirens combing the streets
Chased down like dogs we run from
Your grasp until the sun comes up

We crawl on our knees for you
Under a sky no longer blue
We sweat all day long for you
But we sow seeds to see us through
But sometimes dreams just don't come true
Look now at what they've done to you

White needles buried in the red
The engine roars and then it gives
But never dies
'Cause we don't live
We just survive
On the scraps that you throw away

I won't crawl on my knees for you
I won't believe the lies that hide the truth
I won't sweat one more drop for you
Cause we are the rust upon your gears
We are the insect in your ears
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl, all over you

We sow the seeds to see us through
Our days are precious and so few
We all reap what we are due
Under this sky no longer blue
We bring the dawn all over new
We crawl
We crawl
We crawl, all over you


Hold on slow down again from the top now and tell me everything
I know I've been gone for what seems like forever
But I'm here now waiting
To convince you that I'm not a ghost or a stranger
But closer than you think
She said just go on
To what you pretend is your life
But please don't die on me

Wings won't take me
Heights don't faze me
So take a step
But don't look down
Take a step

Now I'm standing on the rooftop, ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall

Perpetual motion, the image won't focus
A blur is all that's seen
But here in this moment like the eye of the storm
It all came clear to me
I found a shoulder to lean on
An infallible reason to live all by itself
I took one last look from the heights that I once loved
And then I ran like hell

Wings won't take me
Heights don't faze me
So take a step
But don't look down
Take a step

Now I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall

I count the times that I've been sorry
I know, I know
Now my compassion slowly drowns
I know, I know
If there's a time these walls could guard you
I know, I know
Then let that time be right now

Now I'm standing on the rooftop
Now I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall
I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall
I'm think I'm at the edge now but I could be wrong
I'm standing on the rooftop ready to fall

Now I'm standing on the rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on the rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop (ready to fall)
Now I'm standing on a rooftop ready to fall


You talk about the way things were
But I can't hear what you're saying
A time when life was not this hard
Blessed by the innocence

Is the best yet to come?
Or did it pass by long ago?
Are we holding on to a thread
Of something already dead?

I'm not your reason to stand up straight
Shoulders back chest out and eyes raised
Stepping back, I hesitate
I can't let myself be taken

The reception fades, the signals breaking up
And am I moving on or am I giving up?
If you walk away from this with anything
Live your life today


All these days
I'll forever cherish
In the confines of my heart
The faces of ten years ago
Like fingerprints on my heart

How can I breathe
When fear chokes my every breath?
How can I balance
Six inches from death?
Now the momentum we've created
Comes to a screeching halt
This angel comes crashing down
On her hands and knees she crawls

How can I breathe
When fear chokes my every breath?
How many of your lies
Will I be fed?

The remains of summer memories
Spent so far away
Free from the fear or jealousy
That plagues our lives today
Now that promises we're broken
Enemies were made
We spend our precious time pointing fingers
Trying to place the blame

The remains of what's left
Of our past
Of a future yet to come
Of the battles that we've lost
And the fights that we have won


I fell for the bait again
A fork in the road and one never ends...
And upon those stones I lay out alone to find you...
And a whisper like leaves in the wind,
An air so pure it could wash away sin...
A message like a stranger we take kind to

In the night it sings to me
As I fall asleep
Each breath slower than the last
A sweet, low tide recedes

We can almost hear the choir
Echoing down streets on fire
Singing,
"Keep calm, restless world, this too shall pass."

Are we all failures in disguise?
For the dream we brought to life,
From behind our name in lights
Our shadows cast...
But will they last?

It's not that I don't believe
It's just that I'm so afraid to bleed.
If we could just stay on the mountain path, over debris
So I can breathe again,
So we can live like we lived back then,
When these lakes were only puddles
And these monsters were still men...

'Cause we are but saddled horses
As they bet on every race
But there's contempt bred in the stallion
For the man that calls it's name!

We can almost hear the choir
Echoing down streets on fire
Singing,
"Keep calm, restless world, this too shall pass."

Are we all failures in disguise?
For the dream we brought to life,
From behind our name in lights
Our shadows cast...

And feet don't fail me now
There's a broken lonely town
Waiting somewhere down this empty road

And lungs please don't give out
Words we whisper and sometimes shout
And until they're heard,
I'm never going home...

I fell for the bait again... 


Tell me what I'm supposed to do
With all these left over feelings of you
'Cause I don't know
And tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When all these nightmares become real
'Cause I don't know

And I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find
(together)
And I don't know how we
Separate the lies here from the truth
(time)
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do

(together)
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry

And I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find
(together)
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what were supposed to do

(together)
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry
So leave me at the roadside
And hang me up and out to dry

'Cause I don't think you see
The places inside me that I find
(together)
And I don't know how we
Woke up one day somehow thought we knew
Exactly what we're supposed to do
(tim)
...exactly what to do


...So please don't ask me how
I ended up at my wits end and breaking down.
Pages torn from books we never read,
'Cause we're plugged into this grid.
Don't pull this plug right now,
Or then we really have to live.

When I die, will they remember not
What I did, but what I haven't done.
It's not the end, that I fear with each breathe.
It's life that scares me to death...

When we built these dreams on sand,
How they all slipped through our hands.
And this might be our only chance.
Let's take this one day at a time,
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
The time that we kill keeps us alive.

Your words won't save me now.
I'm at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow.
Get a grip on yourself is what they say,
Every hour every day.
Hands over my ears,
I've been screaming all these years!


We came in search of answers!
We left empty handed again!
Shots fired into the sky...
Are now returning!
Where the fuck will you hide!
From the laughter in the closet, some alive
But the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light.
And now our hands extending outward,
Quiet comfort they invite,
And do we dare take what they offer?
Do we step into the light?


When we built these dreams on sand,
How they all slipped through our hands.
And this might be our only chance.
Let's take this one day at a time,
I'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
The time that we kill keeps us alive.


You can't feel the heat until you hold your hand over the flame
You have to cross the line just to remember where it lays
You won't know your worth now, son, until you take a hit
And you won't find the beat until you lose yourself in it

That's why we won't back down
We won't run and hide
'Cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why you stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American dreams
Oh shine your light on me

You can't fill your cup until you empty all it has
You can't understand what lays ahead
If you don't understand the past
You'll never learn the fun now
Till you're standing at the cliff
And you cant truly love until you've given up on it

She told me that she never would face the world again
So I offer up a plan

We'll sneak out when they sleep
And sail off in the night
We'll come clean and start over the rest of our lives
When we're gone we'll stay gone
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late
We have the rest of our lives

We'll sneak out while they sleep
And sail off into the night
We'll come clean and start over the rest of our lives
Out of sight, out of mind
It's not too late
We have the rest of our lives
The rest of our lives
The rest of our lives

Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah 'cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
So catch me if I fall
That's why you stick to your game plans and party lives
But at night we're conspiring by candlelight
We are the orphans of the American dreams
Oh shine your light on me

Because we won't back down
We won't run and hide
Yeah 'cause these are the things we can't deny
I'm passing over you like a satellite
'Cause these are the things that we can't deny now
This is a life that you can't deny us now


It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten,
What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them.
As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping,
Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten.

There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place,
And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds.
But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you?
Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear.

So tell me now,
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know.

That's when she said: "I don't hate you boy,
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save."
That's when I told her: "I love you girl,
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have."

And the day pressed on like crushing weights for no man does it ever wait,
Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes.
Bathed in flames we held the brand uncurled the fingers in your hand.
Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?

So tell me now,
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know.

That's when she said: "I don't hate you boy,
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save."
That's when I told her: "I love you girl,
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have."

One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say,
But so much left that I don't know.
We never had a choice, this world is too much noise.
It takes me under, it takes me under once again.

I don't hate you, I don't hate you, no.
So tell me now,
If this ain't love then how do we get out?
'Cause I don't know.

That's when she said: "I don't hate you boy,
I just want to save you while there's still something left to save."
That's when I told her: "I love you girl,
But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have."

I don't hate you, I don't hate you.
I don't hate you, I don't hate you, no.


Sight unseen, the road stretched out before me.
Suffocate - the water rising slowly.
Step in time, agree to share this pain.
Live or die now, but still we suffer just the same!

I took my share and then told her, "I don't want more"
We spend our lives, then ask you, what was this for,
We gave our time and still we came up short.

'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more.
We save the worst excuse, but the best in store.
Maybe now, we'll finally even the score.
Are you counting? - do you even wanna know?

'Cause unknown, the streets are never-ending.
Sinking down, with nothing to defend me.
Lie and wait, for some small show of mercy.
Questions change - but the answers always stay the same!

I took my share and then told her, "I don't want more"
I fell so low, I touched the oceans floor.
But what the hell are we searching for?!

'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more.
We save the worst excuse, but the best in store.
Maybe now, we'll finally even the score.
Are you counting? - do you even wanna know?

She lies awake now, and cried a thousand rivers.
The circumstance here, has led this child astray.
This candle's fading, the dim light slowly withers.
You ask for guidance, but I just look away...

I have nothing more to say.

So let me down, because they never believed in you.
Seal this crown, and still we can see right through.

'Cause this is all I've got, and I've nothing more.
We save the worst excuse, but the best in store.
Maybe now we'll finally even the score.
'Cause this is all I've got.
And now there's nothing.


The years unfold in one moment
The voices that we heard so loud
Are now suddenly silenced
Inside this crowd

And you're surrounded by the lives
Of those who found something to hold
So bringing everybody down
Is all you know

You've been hiding so long
You can't find yourself
In this sheltered life you live
When everything you want is at your fingertips
You'll never know what need is

You're claiming to be something different
So wanting to believe
That you're better than the rest
To make up for your self-esteem
You talk to hear your own voice and
You've left me no choice but to choose
I miss the person that you were
But I don't miss you

You're the new revolution
The angst-filled adolescent
You fit the stereotype well


Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

I had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home

After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms

Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone


Trying to make a difference
But where the fuck did you go wrong?
Lying to all the names and faces
That have been there all along

How can you ask me to just forget?
All the sick lines
And the words you said
How can you ask me to just forget?
Deny the promises you've made
The things you said
That you hold dear

Behind your empty words
You hide and wait
Until that day you fall in the clear

How can you ask me to just forget?
All the sick lines
And the words you said
How can you ask me to just forget?
Just don't ask me to just forget


Come warm your hands on hellfire and brimstone
Empty the pockets of the innocent victim
Bound by fear
We misplace trust

In your voice
Inside these walls

Convincing us we have no choice
Gaze upon these stare of na'vet'
Two thousand years replaced
With eighteen inches of our faith
Bound by fear
We misplace trust

In your voice
Inside these walls
Convincing us we have no choice

And this reflection
On where the message lies
Stained glass and marble
Or somewhere deep inside
(Somewhere deep inside)
This message you will only find deep inside
To read these words
You keep looking down
But in the sky
This message is written in the clouds


If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end,
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now,
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address,
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown, to the very end,
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now,
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

'Guilty' is what our graves will read,
No years, no family,
We did nothing to stop the murder of a people just like us


Floating in the clouds, giving up the fight
A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light

We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sun

A sun flickered like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Vapid shadows in a world gone static
We're running away line by the fading line

Under water for years we're fine,
Till we started to swim, then drown
The current takes us,
Now we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
Broken, beaten, tired of
You wanted to love but don't know how
Diagnosis sudden life
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Woke up falling on a wave of golden sound
Tunnel vision and a great beyond
Heart beating like a rhythm slowing down
Now it's gone, I let go of a soul

A flat line and I'm closing down
Whisper a warm farewell
The flames all beckon me
As we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life? (Walking into the light)
Broken, beaten, tired of
You wanted to love but don't know how
Diagnosis: sudden life
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Don't suppose that you know the way
Don't suppose that you care
I see lights up ahead and hear
Cries of angels ringing in my ears
But you know that, had you a choice,
You would go back and do it again
We all have unfinished business to tend

So no I won't go gentle
Into the good night
You can keep your candle
I'm walking away from the light
Yeah I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light

Diagnosis sudden life (Walking into the light)
I woke up my heart racing, I'm
At a loss explaining why
Are you dying all your life?
Now put your darkest days behind
And laugh as its right before your eyes
And for very the first time,
It feels like I'm walking away from the light


Somewhere between happy, and  total fucking wreck
Feet sometimes on solid ground, sometimes at the edge
To spend your waking moments, simply counting time
Is to give up on your hopes and dreams, give up on your?

Life for you, has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive, is what makes us who we are

An obvious disinterest, a barely managed smile
I'll take a deep nod in agreement, a status quo exile
I shirk my obligations, I miss all your deadlines
I'm excel at quitting early, you're fucking up my life

Life for you, has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive, is what makes us who we are

All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so fucking great
All smiles and sunshine, a perfect world on a perfect day
Everything always works out, I have never felt so great

(Life isn't like this) [Repeat x4]
Life isn't like this [Repeat x2] (Life isn't like this) [Repeat x3]

Are we verging on an answer, fucking up my?

Life for you, has been less than kind
So take a number, stand in line
We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt
But how we survive, is what makes us who we are

(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are
(Who we are)
Makes us who we are
(Who we are)
It's what makes us who we are
(Who we are)


Block the entrances
Close the door
Seal the exits
Because this is war

All gave some
Some gave all
But for what
I want to know

Carry on
Don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve

A folded flag
A purple heart
A family all but torn apart
I fought with courage to preserve
Not my way of life, but yours

Carry on
Don't mind me
All I gave was everything
And yet you ask me for more
Fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve

The cowards preach from pedestals
With words and courage and resolve
But one thing that'll fuck 'em all
'Cause is freedom isn't free

They send our daughters and our sons
To deserts under burning suns
A sacrificial slaughter to fill
The pockets of the weak
An artificial enemy
Are we so easily deceived?

Come, carry on
Just walk away
How many more sent to their graves
In this lesson ignored?
I fought your fight
Bought your lie
And in return I lost my life
What purpose does this serve?
What purpose did I serve?


Am I loud and clear, or am I breaking up?
Am I still your charm, or am I just bad luck?
Are we getting closer, or are we just getting more lost?

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away,
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end,
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

I've been here so long, I think that it's time to move
The winter's so cold, summer's over too soon
Let's pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends, some that I hardly know
But we've had some times, I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand until you hold my hand
Until you hold my hand

I'll show you mine if you show me yours first
Let's compare scars, I'll tell you whose is worse
Let's unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

We live on front porches and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets until you hold my hand

Swing life away
Swing life away
Swing life away
Swing life away


The music played with a common frequency
The speakers gently seeped the sound
Of ambient keyboards and light percussion
Creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive
Through curtains of blackness

The windows were cold to the touch
Reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity
Salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass
And streets with melted snow cascaded down it's length

The music pulsed louder, yet gentle
Like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water
The skylight was glowing faintly
With a vague hints of an impending dawn

The car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road
And she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel
Two degrees in the past twenty minutes
Or hardly spoken

As we were, so perfect, so happy
I'll remember, only our smiles
'Cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found
Are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were, so perfect, so happy

'Why are you doing this''
She spoke without expecting a response
Her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive
So silent my heart had jumped

'I'm not doing anything', I said
But I didn't even believe that myself
'This is what's best, for me, for you, for us
Or maybe just for me,' I thought
As a tear formed in the pit of her eye

The music poured through the speakers
And we were losing ourselves in the cadence
She looked down momentarily and closed her eyes
For a bit longer than a standard blink

Then she was crying, then she was shouting
Then I was shouting, now pouring confessions
Having no answers or solutions
And we barely could even hear the questions

As we were so perfect, so happy
I'll remember, only our smiles
'Cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found
Are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were so perfect, so happy

don't put me underground
I was meant for a life somewhere else
Please, Lord, give me the way
Before both of us haunt you
We'll steal tonight
(We'll steal tonight)

As we were so perfect, so happy
Don't remember, only your smiles
'Cause that's all they've seen
Long since dried, when we are found
Are the tears in which we had drowned
As we were so perfect, so happy

Our cracking voices became part of the music
The car pressed on faster through he night
As our voices lowered, the cadence again overtook the air
Up ahead there was a curve approaching
She made no indications of slowing


I'm not fucking blind to the way
That you talk around the truth
Not just what you say
But what you do

Played this tug of war way too fucking long
Like every time
Again I've lost
You've won

You took advantage of the trust that I gave
Took my forgiveness
Rubbed it back in my face
Reaching for words but there's nothing to say
I'm left to wonder
Will this ever be the same?

This rage
Burning through my veins
Regret consumes my mind
Cutting deeply like a razor blade

Will I live to see another day
Without questioning your motives?
With constant doubt

You took advantage of the trust that I gave
Took my forgiveness
Rubbed it back in my face
Reaching for words
But there's nothing to say
I'm left to wonder
Will this ever be the same?

And as we sit back waiting
For these scars to heal
Try to convince ourselves
That this
That this isn't real

Will you allow me forget your past?
Or will you always hang it over my head?


A currency of heartache and sorrow
The air we breathe is stale with mold
To shadows we are slaves digging deeper every day
But emptiness is growing so old

Headlamps light the tunnels we wander
They shimmer and they dance on the walls
We're lost inside these caves as the chances of escape
Grow slimmer 'til there's no chance at all

This ink, it travels from the page
Up my hand and to my veins
Choking on those stories I've told
If there are words here left to say
I just want to let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
And I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now

We traffic in the blackest of markets
Trade misery like diamonds and gold
The angst that we exchange for applause or petty praise
Is finally now taking its toll

But there's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
We're washing off the dirt from our clothes
I don't want to live without
I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
And I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now
Right now

(Black stains) they mark me like a letter
(Won't fade) cracking under the pressure
(Black stains) nothing stays gold

There's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
But we're lost deep down in these holes
And I've seen the way out
Now I just want to let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now (black stains)
I'm covered in the mess I made (won't fade)
These colors used to wash right out (black stains)
But now they are a part of me
And I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
Your voice it washes the stains away
(Wash the stains away)
(Wash the stains away)


She got down on hands and knees, one ear against the ground,
Holding her breath to hear something, but the dirt made not a sound tonight

Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores, where we
Danced just to please the gods that only ask for more, so it goes

But still we give ourselves to this
We can't spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip


The postcard says wish you were here
But I'd rather I was there, holding
On to the simple things before they disappear, that's what I meant

But that was then, and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

Our destination, a feint smile,
Another station, another mile,
Another day gone, I swear that I will
Be there before dawn, so be there I will

She got down on hands and knees, one ear against the ground,
Holding her breath to hear something, anything at all

The dirt whispered, "Child, I'm coming home."

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
But the daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip


Spray paint the cameras, jam the frequency,
What you kill, just comes alive in me,
Hoods and bandanas make not an enemy,
You can't define us, any way you please!

You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my sins absolved

Because I found God (hey!)
In the sound of your factories burning down,
Now I sleep so sound...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let it go?

Instead of doing what's right, they built higher walls
Where we can't shed a light on true criminals
When business and suffering is one and the same
When laws fail the people they turn to the flame

I found love (love!)
I found life (life!)
As a thorn stuck in your side,
And you wonder why...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?

Will you hold on? (Will you hold on?)
Did you hold on or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?

When it all comes down,
When it all comes down...

When the lights all blow out, and roadblocks blow up,
When you sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?


I'm calling out
Only echoes respond
But I scream 'til my voice is gone
Crouching in corners and hiding your face
I'm sick and tired of playing your games

I'm not alone
I stand amongst the voiceless
Millions in the unforgiving sun

Here arm-in-arm
We parade these streets
And sing our songs (and sing our songs)

We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)

Unknowing, we lie and wait for the rain
To wash away what they have made
Face down in the dirt with your foot on my back
In the distance I hear thunder crack

C'mon stand up!
This system of power and privilege is about to come to an end
Here come the clouds
The first drop is falling down (falling down)

We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)

Our futures burn in red horizons
Ashes scattered in winds of change
Casualty numbers are rising
Now it's time to raise the stakes

We're meant for something more than living just to put food on our plates
I can't help but wonder--why should we participate?

We've had enough
Is there even anything left to explain? (We've had enough)
Am I really someone you need to restrain? (We've had enough)
Can't you listen to what we have to say? (We've had enough)


Man walks along the railroad track
He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom Said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! [repeat 8 times]

And the highway is alive tonight
nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of Tom Joad.


In fields where nothing grew but weeds
I found a flower at my feet
Bending there in my direction

I wrapped a hand around its stem
And pulled until the roots gave in
Finding there what I've been missing
And I know

So I tell myself, tell myself, it's wrong
There's a point we pass
From which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

All because of you, I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore, where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice, all you have to do is shout it out

Inside my hands these petals browned
Dried up fallen to the ground
But it was already too late now

I pushed my fingers through the earth
Returned this flower to the dirt
So it could live, I walked away now but I know

Not a day goes by when I don't feel this burn
There's a point we pass
From which we can't return
I felt the cold rain of the coming storm

All because of you I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
I'll follow your voice, all you have to do is shout it out

All because of you
All because of you

All because of you I haven't slept in so long
When I do I dream of drowning in the ocean
Longing for the shore where I can lay my head down
Inside these arms of yours

All because of you I believe in angels
Not the kind with wings no, not the kind with halos
The kind that bring you home
When home becomes a strange place
I'll follow your voice, all you have to do is shout it out


There's a fire on the borders
And it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger
And it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave

And the world says we reap what we sow
To where I bury you up in my home
The nights we'll reclaim but we're sick of the wait

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours
We want it all and we want it now
A tide has come in to drown you out
We make ourselves at home while your body's still warm

Creation tell us that the rituals
Are only just clocks on wrong times
And something triggers each
And every time I hear you say
God bless this place

But your numbers are dwindling now
Though endangered we'll still hunt you down
With heads on a stake long may you reign

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours
We want it all and we want it now
A tide has come in to drown you out
We make ourselves at home
While your body's still warm

And there's a fire on the borders
And it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger
And it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave

We want the motherfucking world and we want it now
Tonight I'll watch your fires burn out
With guns in hand we pry these guns from yours

No I don't want to wait
I know I better way
So step aside, come on or better yet just go away
Our chance has finally come
Tomorrow I'll be another one now
No I'm not gonna wait
We want it now
Yeah we're dousing the flames
We want it now


Welcome home
While away
They have tampered with the locks
And your things they rearranged
"We propose,
A better way"
Said the note they left behind
In their wake of disarray

You fell in place
Don't fall asleep
They'll find us here
I know a place
To disappear
As a voice proclaimed

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'till the day we die
Or 'till we don't have the strength to go on
'Till we don't have the strength to go on

Let us cry
Let us be
Let us open up our hearts
Without fear of anything
Faith alone's
All we need
To traverse this burning bridge
Now before it gets too late

You claim, "it's fine"
But the heart reveals
What smiles betray
Your sad sad eyes
Gave you away
And don't you know

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'till the day we die
Or 'till we don't have the strength to go on
'Till we don't have the strength to go on

Our shoulders bear an awful weight
But still we trudge on just the same
Our colors run then leave a stain
They blacken our once honest name
How can we argue, tell me
Over the fury and the fire
How many times can we tell you that we
Are not like you, we see right through
The poor disguise that fails to fool
The wary eye is trained on you

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'till the day we die
Or 'till we don't have the strength to go on
'Till we don't have the strength to go on

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'till the day we die
Or 'till we don't have the strength to go on
'Till we don't have the strength to go on

Yeah we don't have the strength to go on.


And all these things that we tie together
Keep unraveling apart
And the light that used to burn so bright
Now is dark
With anger-laced intent we set fire
To the bridges that remain
And they're wading through the current now

And they drown in the flood of the tears
That have been wept
And I scream to the sky
"No you are not alone"

If you think that you're words will ever make a difference
Think again and carry on
Because the weight behind the hand that holds us is strong
But there is hope in the roar of a thousand pleading cries
And all these things that we tie together

The sound of their tongues being bitten
Is all I hear
As we fire at the whites of their eyes then
Dance on ashes of the world

As they drown in the flood of the tears
That have been wept
And their tongues being bitten
Is all that I can hear
As I scream to the sky
"I need you now"

Can you feel this truth now unraveling?
Or will you chase the burning sun
Into the sea


Dancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or is it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
"That can never happen here" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or is it all a dream?

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough
Or is it all a dream?

To a predetermined fate are we condemned
Or maybe we're a book without an end
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control 
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue 
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away! 

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

We travel back to what we take
We need a storm, let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations 
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep 
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from our shadows and into the light 

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream?


Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.
Always stepped in time, regardless of the beat
I moved my feet, I carried weight
What I could not do I faked
I dug seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave
So I stopped right there and said

Go on alone, 'cause I won't follow.
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
The path will be my own

This is the part where the needle skips
And the chorus plays like a sink that drips
A syllable repeating, like a warning we aren't heeding
Until all of a sudden we noticed it
When the wheels brace and the tires grip
A map we've been misreading
A defeat we're not conceding
Until now
There must be some other way out

Go on alone, because I won't follow
But this isn't giving up no this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
A path to take me home

(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)

The wind died
The whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet
Her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes
For just a moment or two
She asked why
I said "I don't know why,
I just know"

The wind died
The whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet
Her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes
For just a moment or two
She asked why
I said "I don't know why
I just know
I just know"

Go on alone, 'cause I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
I made most of all this sorrow
I tried to brave this discontent, but now I'm through
I'm letting go of you.

This is letting go
This is letting go

Once upon a time I could take anything, anything.


Are we so alone,
So distant,
So forgotten,
As we think ourselves to be?

These are our lives
But did they ever even matter?
Are we worth remembering?

These machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams
We're throwing wrenches in the gears
Our lives will not be lived in vain

When this is all said and done
We spent this life on the run
Judged by the company we keep

Our language, buried inside 
These lungs that keep us alive
We breathe so selfishly

Promises we plan to break
Are made in whispered voices
Cause our despair knows many names

We make mistakes
But we apologize with roses we never stop to smell along the way

These machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams
We're throwing wrenches in the gears
Our lives will not be lived in vain

We fell from the sky today
We melt into balls of clay
We sell ourselves everyday
Don't tell me how to live this way

Pushed so far to the edge
We teeter just on the brink
You can lead me to the bloodbath
But you can't make me drink

As these machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying dreams
We're throwing wrenches in the gears
Our lives will not be lived in vain
Our lives will not be lived in vain


If I could paint how I feel, I'd draw bullseye on your forehead
My anger is not misdirected unless it somehow misses you

Time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away

So cast the stones that I'll gladly catch
And I'll throw them right back, I stand behind the things I say,
You type the words you won't say to my face

Time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away

It seems you've let me go again, just like the day you let me in, the best of intentions,
You were never mine to begin with

So step away from the fucking screen, see a world outside your scene,
Maybe then you will know and realize the lack of threat you pose


So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think its time to move on (when will you say)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine
Walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs,
To them these streets belong

My atonement lasts the best part of eternity(eternity)
Ran out of hands to count the sin that breeds inside of me (inside of me)
Not this hate but the loneliness has left me here into this mess of

My hands are soaking in the blood of angels
On broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away

Head hung from shame we bear a weight that brings me to a crawl (to a crawl)
These years of lounging tell of decades of unanswered calls (unanswered calls)
For a change, 'cause everyday we slip and fall
Kicked while were down, our fists clenched into a ball

My hands are soaking in the blood of angels
On broken wings they collapse (will I see the break of day)
Dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
All these lost halos wash away

So look in my eyes, what will you leave behind once you've gone? (so precious)
You got what you came for now I think its time to move on (when will you say)
But these ghosts come alive like water and wine
Walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs
To them these streets belong


On clearer days I can see the lights from my bedroom door,
On windy nights I can smell the lake as it drifts to me from the shore
The traffic lights silently change a thousand times a day
But I'm still waiting, yeah, and I'm still waiting
And if my hand could block the sun,
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks,
Would that be time enough? I can't remember exactly when this longing began
But I know it wasn't before the day you touched my hand,
Laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged,
But I'm still waiting, yeah, and I'm still waiting
And if my hand could block the sun,
Would we ever wake up? And if I turned back all these clocks,
Would that be time enough?
So put your hands where I can see them,
And shut your mouth, I know who you are,
In a world void of feeling or heart I know that we are the torches in the dark
Let's break this down, let's make this count,
Let's leave this one-horse town, no better time than now [repeat x2]
The angels dance like feathers float, they're here to see and to be seen,
The clock strikes two, the music slows and each one slowly dons their wings,
Once outside they all pair off and hand in hand they leave
But I'm still waiting, yeah, and I'm still waiting
And if my hand could block the sun,
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks,
Would that be time enough?
Will we ever wake up?


Seven hundred miles to play to fifteen angry men
I need some sleep
They hate the songs
We hate them too, yeah
This show is free
Fifteen minutes in broke another fucking string
Just call it luck
They start to leave
I start to plead
Someone, someone yells you suck

Suddenly that joe kicks on in my veins
And I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears, and move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go...

Two cool kids they came
They're huddled by the door
Eyes wide with fright
A guy, a girl, in love with the whole world
It almost makes it right

Suddenly that joe kicks on in my veins
And I cool down
Things sound good right now
Suddenly fists turn into brave ears, and move as one
Funny how no one knows we came
They wouldn't come anyway
Should I feel grateful to play
I'm living life my way
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home
I fell in love with my enemies
I let go of everything I had left at home

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing must go wrong

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing must go wrong


On the edges of the sharpest knives
In the middle of the darkest nights
Always knew that I would find you here
In a puddle of the bravest tears

I've seen enough to know it's lonely where you are
Above the crowd
Feet dangling from a rooftop (a rooftop)
She waits from ledges for a voice to talk her down

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
To laugh again some day

All that matters is the time we had
Doesn't matter how it all went bad
Never wonder what it might be like
Shut the door, say goodbye

When faced with tragedy
We come alive or come undone
So don't hold back, let it shape you like an ocean
Even the deepest scars in time will fade

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
Yeah, we're holding on to laugh again some day

And sometimes you have to go back
To know just where you have been
But we're old enough to know that
What has been, will be again and again

And the bravest of faces are the ones where we fake it
And the roles that we play

Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds, tomorrow came

And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay a while
You'll be ready then, to laugh again

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are tragedy, yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are misery, a distant memory)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learned to laugh again
Yeah, we all learned to laugh again
We all learned to laugh again


Wake me up inside, tell me there's a reason, to take another step
To get up off my knees and follow this path of most resistance
Whatever it takes us, whatever it faces and where ever it leads

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine, I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside

Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Though we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping
And I spend my time here alive but barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it, do you think we'll ever really see

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine, I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside

Wake me up inside, these dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside, today won't start if we just give in
Don't show me anything

Just wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream
Wake me up inside


Here along we wander and we roam
We cut our teeth in city streets and gutters we call home
Await the day the clouds will part
Deliver words we know by heart

Raise your fucking voice
Or be a face in the crowd
Isn't that what it's all about?

So tempt me not with the life you have bought
Our keep is earned in the change that we sought
Explain away the tangled truth
Accuse away but without proof

Raise your fucking voice
Or be a face in the crowd
Isn't that what it's all about?

Boots on the ground, aim tried and true
Bells toll the sound; impending doom
In our respite our numbers grew
Now it's time to

Raise your fucking voice
Or be a face in the crowd
Isn't that what it's all about?
Is that what this is about?


Can you hear the desperate cries that are calling out your name?
Twisting your arms, holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve
Do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now

I can't bear the thought of losing,
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings
I'm so sick of all these people
But I'm scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago and so I

I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes
I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

The heart is something you can't control
We either choose to follow or be left on our own
So we're leaving here on a less-traveled road
As desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close, getting close

I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes
I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight,
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes


Do you see the world in different colors?
Do you see the world in black and gray?
Alone in your thoughts
How many others have stood where you stand
Where you stand today?
I've stood where you stand
But all, can you

Wait for me now?
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

The promise of safe return undelivered
The ocean is wider than I first guessed
When roads disappeared, I followed the rivers
But somehow got in over my head
So deep I felt taken

Wait for me now
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now

A lost dream of what could have been
A house on fire, a tangled web
The key turns to find the locks have changed
In time to hear the back door slam
A sound that to this day I can't forget
The colors drained to black and gray
Oh

Wait for me now
Take off this crown
To break all that defiles
Don't you know?
Wait for me now
The end's robbed me now
Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me now


Speak with hesitation
Talk with reservation
Blood on your hands
Dried long since
But guilt still glowing in your eyes
You hide behind

(And now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(Guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you try

Now I've watched you stack
The mistakes you've made
On top of the lies
To hide them
Your excuses just don't add up
Empty handed we all wonder
Why you hide behind

(And now this blood has long since dried)
Your perfect crime
(Guilt still glowing in your eyes)
Never ask why you try

Now I know that
Your words
Your actions
Intentions
All were lies
Your heart grows heavier with time

(And now this blood has long since dried)
Have I said enough?
Have I said too much?
Is it your responsibility to decide?
Your heart grows heavier with time
(I will decide)

And I fell victim to the changing tide
And this blood has long since dried
This blood has long since dried


All hail, the jester has landed
In flyover country he sings
Charmed like a snake in a basket
Should be curled up and ready to spring
We're raising our cross just to burn it
The clergy are selling their souls
Clearing a path, ignoring the facts
Intoxicated by the throne

We'll be standing here holding our ground, come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go

When we all go deaf in the chamber of echoes
Cheering the missile parade
Agreeing to let all the banks rob the people
Together we circle the drain

We'll be standing here holding our ground, come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
Welcome to the breakdown
We've got nowhere else to go

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go

It's a game, you've been played
It's a flock, you're the sheep
It's a pied-piper song that has lulled you to sleep
It's a lie and you fell for it - hook, line, and sinker
A hand that you shook that then gave you the finger
A fraud and a fake, a cowardly king
A lie to your face, but you still kiss the ring
This is the breakdown, this is the breakdown
This is the breakdown!

Standing here holding our ground, come what may
Like a ghost haunts from beyond the grave

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go

Welcome to the breakdown
Welcome to the end of the road
This is a breakdown
And we've got nowhere else to go
It's not much, but this is home
And there's nowhere else to go


What are we gonna do?
Said the hungry child to a father with empty hands
What are we gonna do?
When the smoke clears
And reveals no promise land
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, it's a long, long way to go.
What are we gonna do?

Smashed across the table like a pile of fallen leaves
She stares down at unpaid bills then up at him
And unaware the journey that his father made for him
But when the man asked for his papers
He replied with empty hands
Then from the graves we dig for dreams, not realize
Do you hear these muffled cries?
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?
And who is going to answer for our sins
Could it be you?
Or me, when they lift our fingerprints

What are we gonna do?
I don't know, it's a long, long way to go
What are we gonna do?

Somewhere in the spaces of a 9 round magazine
The cowards pulling triggers at the seam
And the apple of our eyes cannot survive these sharpened teeth
Like Abraham and Isaac,
We will sacrifice and like it
And when the sun sets
We will wait there patiently
We fall sleep but we don't dream
What are we gonna do?

Said the lion to the lamb
As they drew lines in the sand
Said the trees to the man
When there were no seeds left to plant
Said the widow to the grave
As her roses fade away
Said the hills to the sky
As they kissed our last goodbye

Said the worker to the chief
Less like a boss, more like a thief
Said the ocean to the shore
As the tides grow more and more
Said the soldier to the priest
What is it that I should believe?
Said the desert to the rain
When will you visit us again?

How can we explain to children dancing in the rain
What are we gonna do?


To the ends of this lost world
You have marched and you have sworn
To a tainted crown of thorns

As the hungry sails unfurl
We are trusted from the shore
And it's you that we search for

The blackest night
The midnight sun
The covered tracks and days spent on the run
The strangers we've become

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Another place, another time
We toed the same side of the line
Yeah we saw eye to eye

Even then the saddest sounds,
Were nothing laughter could not drown
But we are not laughing now

I see your face
In my sights
I hesitate
And then look for a sign
Somewhere in the sky

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Even together, we stand apart
Swallow the sun, erase the sky
An invitation has been declined
Where did you go? Where did you go?

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright now
Oh, oh


It's alright now
'Cause all is forgiven
If you could just listen
It's alright
It's alright.


As long as I remember the rains been coming down
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages, tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain?

I went down Virginia, to seek shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable, we watched the tower grow
Five year plans and new deals, wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain?

We heard the singer playin', and how we cheered for more
The crowd had rushed together, just tryin' to keep warm
But still the rain kept fallin', fallin' on my ears
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain?


Light up the torches and wake up the King
The smoke you've ignored is a flame you can't contain

We circle the walls and claw at the dirt
We growl from our guts and howl until it hurts

I told her 'come with me
And I can take you from this place now
Somewhere these roads all go
A place so we can start again'
I grabbed her hand and pulled her close
She looked at me and said
'Hey I don't even know your name'

'But are you ready to explode?
Like a tiger in a circus?
Cracking whips are all I know
And searching for a sense of purpose'

We are the wolves at the gates
Our numbers growing every day, yeah
But you can't fight us all no
No you can't fight
We are the wolves at the wall
We break in like a waterfall, yeah
But you can't fight us all no
No you can't fight

The water is breaching the walls of the dam
Trampling dreams in a rush to higher land

Are you ready to explode
Like a tiger in a circus?
This cage is all I've ever known
But now you've given me a purpose

We are the wolves at the gates
Our numbers growing every day, yeah
But you can't fight us all no
No you can't fight
We are the wolves at the wall
We break in like a waterfall, yeah
But you can't fight us all no
We are not that we are

Roaming in numbers and chasing the scent
Circling in for the kill
And you are the winter, the long discontent
We won't stop till we've had our fill

(We are the wolves)
Roaming in numbers and chasing the scent
(We are the wolves)
Circling in for the kill
(We are the wolves)
And you are the winter, the long discontent
(We are the wolves)
We won't stop till we've had our fill

We are the wolves
We are the wolves
We are the wolves


Set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race

(Let's go!)

Take a breath and explode like bullets
Tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade
Then try to separate the skin
Now when the
White flames are burning flags
We found a world worth dying for yeah

We've been battered so hard that
We don't feel anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?

Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
Fill your eyes in the strains of thought
Outside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow
Like a glacier melting
Watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world
But all I found was hate

Now when the
White flames are burning flags
We found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that
I can't close my eyes anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?

Don't ask me why
'Cuz I don't know
Don't ask me how
I'm gonna solve this on my own
Don't ask me why
'Cuz I don't know
These things I'll never face
Scratch out the warning race
The wreckage of a job well done
I saw a place I'd never seen before, yeah
And that morning I refused to close my eyes anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we
All die young?

So take me [2x]


I'm saddling in here for the long haul
Can't hide forever is what they say
In with the wind, out with a bang
Meanwhile nothing has changed

With each one slowly ordered
A storm brews in her eyes
A miss shot at the buzzard
Time whether wasted or well spent is still time

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest times
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

The moments of clarity here are short lived
Bleed through the bandages again
The wind is a lie, no longer white
Black as a day without sun

Passed out in a gutter
Woke up in your arms
Nursed back into color
The same touch that heals me
Left the scar

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest times
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don't recognize
But we return here all together

And the world works in ways that I never
Have claimed to know
We got out and fought through the weather
But it followed
The view from here isn't better
But it's all we know
It's all we know

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the edge of the borderlines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
Who we become you won't recognize
But became them all together
All together


I want so badly to believe
In the world in the magazines
Better homes
Life refined
(But I'm) without a catalyst
Without the glossy print

I'm wearing thin
Like the conscience of a funeral arranger
Wearing thin and breaking fast
Shallow breaths
Don't look this way
Because I'll pull you in
Because I'll pull you in faster
Than you can say, "go"

You'll be all I have, you're fucked
Times owns my body and my mind
Escape is on my mind
Escape is on my mind

Life redefined, cyclical days of
Waking, working, regretting
Listen
Hear that void? 
Listen
Hear that void? 

It's me
It's me
It's me
It's me


Keep driving them up as much as you can
And we'll keep driving them of
Just as long as the cash flow keeps moving
Makes no difference to them anyway

You're reaching records at a rapid pace
And you've brought heartlessness at an all time high
This cute little tease that you have going on
I bet all seems like a joke to you

Giving us hope for a little bit of time
Just to go flip on our lives again
Giving us hope for a little bit of time
Just to go flip on our lives again

They continue to ignore the fact that these are our lives
But through thick and thin you won't keep us down
They continue to ignore the fact that these are our lives
But through thick and thin you won't keep me down
Three digits later need to fill it again
From our cards to their hands that are covered in their sin

I hope it fills the hole where your heart was
So we can stop seeing right through you
So we can stop seeing right through you
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can
Keep driving them up as much as you can


This is capital, we all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors
This is capital, we all can't be movie stars, can't have Hollywood
This is capital
But we can lose these wants and set ourselves free instead
We'll watch their perfect world collapse as we paint the towns red 

We all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors
This is capital, we all can't be movie stars, can't have Hollywood
This is capital

We all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors
This is capital, we all can't be movie stars, can't have Hollywood
This is capital

We all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors
This is capital, we all can't be movie stars, can't have Hollywood
This is capital

We all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors
This is capital, we all can't be movie stars, can't have Hollywood
This is capital 

We all can't be lawyers, can't be doctors


Yeah!

To all our fallen comrades
You've played a part in this
To all our fallen comrades
Don't you forget the day we started this

Close your eyes as it starts to fade
Do you regret the changes that we made?
I hope you find some comfort while you're at home

I don't blame you
I don't hold a grudge on you
I will not look down upon you
And I won't hold you down

I swear we'll never forget your names
To all our fallen comrades
You've played a part in this
To all our fallen comrades

Don't you forget the day we started this
Leaving this all behind and starting over
Leaving this all behind and starting over
Breaking this chain of strength, starting over

This is what we chose
The changes that we made
These roads become our home away from home
Always away from home
Always away from home

I swear I'll never forget your name
I swear we'll never forget your name
We've brought this further than we ever thought we could
We've brought this further than we ever thought we could


What gives you the right to think that you can come and save me?
Picture perfect world, I picture violence in disguise
I'll save my breath for something real as you look towards the sky
Pray forgiveness this Ends tonight

I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
Restless I found your weakness
Restless I found your weakness

I can tell that you have been under his control
Making subtle movements being oppressed inside your home
Wearing this mask to hide yourself from the world
Falling short, pray forgiveness

I am a demon so deliver me from this
From this, I'm in
I am a demon so deliver me from this
From this, I'm in
From this moment on, I see a world shattered and cold
I see the problems, I see the broken homes

And it's all starting to get old
All this good news is bad news just waiting to unfold
And it's all starting to get old
All this good news is so old

I'm not listening
We're not listening
I'm not listening
We're not listening

We all will die alone
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I just can't stop dreaming
I've been awake for 40 days and 40 nights and I'm so
Restless I found your weakness
Restless I found your weakness

I am a demon so deliver me from this
I am a demon so deliver me
From this very moment
From this very moment

I am a demon so deliver me from this
I see the problems
I see the broken homes
Restless, I found your weakness


I know a place
Where the wounded go
For cold souls unaware
With no self control
I know a place
Where the broken and wounded go 

You just sit back and listen
And just do what you're told
Never knowing how things
Could have been as you grow old
This is your time and it's wearing thin
Don't let this happen again and again
You can catch me in a storm 
Of thoughts and prayers
Sleep away your American nightmare 

I won't lie with you in your grave
Sleep away your American nightmare
Sleep, it
Sleep it away
Your American nightmare 

You just sit back and listen
And just do what you're told
Never knowing how things
Could have been as you grow old
This is your time and it's wearing thin
Don't let this happen again and again 

I may be wounded
I don't need to be saved
And though I'm wounded
I don't need to be saved 

I won't lie, I won't lie
With you in your grave 

So put your fist in the air
To the sound of the new beat


You had us fooled from the start
Give it up, give it up we finally know who you are
You had us fooled from the start
Give it up, give it up
No one wanted you here
And no one fucking cared

You've burned every bridge we built
But you managed to gain your ground
Hope you got what you came here for
I hope you're satisfied with getting left behind
Looks like your mouth got the best of you

Fraudulent intentions got the best of you
Looks like your mouth got the best of you
Fraudulent intentions got you nowhere fast
Looks like your mouth got the best of you;

Give it up you fake mother fucker
If it was me we would have left you there
That shits no dice get the fuck out of here
If it was up to me we would have left you there

Fuck you
This is my favorite part
This is where you fall apart, downward
Downward from here
You had us fooled from the start
Give it up, give it up we finally know who you are
You had us fooled from the start
Give it up, give it up

Looks like your mouth got the best of you
Fraudulent intentions got you nowhere fast

Looks like your mouth got the best of you
Give it up you fake mother fucker
You've had it coming to you
I hope you're satisfied with getting left behind

You've had it coming to you
I hope you're satisfied
Give it up, give it up, give it up
You've had it coming for you
You've had it coming


When that one thing that you wanted
Becomes the reason your falling
Remember nothing worth having comes easy
So find a reason in you

When that one thing that you wanted
Becomes the reason your falling
Remember nothing worth having comes easy
So find a reason in you

Turn it up!
So keep your head in the game
No need for shallow obscenities
Shine through misfortunes and memories

When you feel like you've just had enough
Shit gets rough, don't give up
Stop feeling like you're failing

When that one thing that you wanted
Becomes the reason you're falling

I'll shine through misfortunes and memories
(When that one thing that you wanted)
I'll shine through misfortunes and memories
(Becomes the reason your falling)

I'll shine through misfortunes and memories
(Remember nothing worth having comes easy)
I'll shine through misfortunes and memories
(So find a reason in you)


You've been waiting so long to find it in yourself that you have nothing
You've been trying to find yourself through the years
From the start to the finish line
And I can say I have been honest with you
But you're not gonna listen, You don't ever listen

Make your own, make your own history
Leave behind your legacy
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
Leave behind, leave behind your legacy

Blindly following footsteps before you know it
Traveled closer to your own death
Through the years you've misplaced identities
A hybrid of lies and apologies

Think for yourself
Prove to everyone that your life means something
Do you want to be alive?

Make your own, make your own history
Leave behind your legacy
Make your own, make your own
Make your own history
Leave behind, leave behind your legacy

Stop trying to be something that you're not
Start thinking with your heart and focus on what you got
Make your mark on the world
Because the only lives that count are the ones that make an impact

To live a life is to be profound
Pick yourself up get your feet off the ground
No use for everything to be handed to you
The higher the better it doesn't matter what you do

Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own history
Make your own


So come on, come on, come on
This is a social let down
These are the things that I've been dying to say
These are the things that have been ending one minute at a time
If misery loves company, then maybe I'll just sleep alone

Hey hey
Hey hey manipulator
Hey hey

I'll keep you in mind
These are some of the things I've been dying to say
If misery loves company, then maybe I'll just sleep alone
If misery loves company, you can find me in a crowded room

In the years I've spent alive, I'm finding hope and disappointment
Nobody wins this race, high hopes will only hurt you
So when the word and everyone in it, turns their back on your
That's when you'll know, that's when you'll fucking know
That you've got the word in the palm of your hand

It goes fuck my life
I said fuck my life and this misery
Fuck my life, singing fuck my life
I'm not sleeping alone


I've become so detached from the things that were once so important to me,
Brick walls in the road trying hard to remember
But never asking to forget
And I ask you help me never to forget
And when you ask my brother if he knows my name
I assure you that the answer will be you know "I don't think we ever met"

It's time to let go
Bury the past
But not to forget the times that we had
But I can look back at everything we've done back then let go
I've done all that I can

Now when I reach our you run to your nearest haven
When I look into your eyes I almost feel embarrassed

I've done all that I could
But you're ripping things away
So weak and so powerful
So content with the lies you say

But I don't know if its the feeling of defeat
That is stinging my heart
Or is it the void inside of me that is asking to be filled
I never thought that I could feel this way before
And now I find myself never asking to forget

It's time to let go
Bury the past
But not to forget the times that we had
Good lives when you know there's nothing left to hold
Let go I've done all that I can

So weak so powerful
So content with the lies you say


How easy is it to go through life disregarding everything
Thoughtlessness flows in a time where wrong is right
Yeah i'm gonna prove you wrong
Let me tell you about your flaws
I know them all

Staring at the screen not saying what you mean
There's gotta be more to life than complaining
There's gotta be more that you can offer
Let me tell you about your flaws

Everyone is all the same, everyone you know
Hiding watching waiting
You've built this anger because you don't want to put any effort
Into saying something worth saying
Negative and violent, we're all so important

Let me tell you about your flaws, I see them all
Everyone is all the same, everyone you know
Hiding watching waiting
There's gotta be more to life than complaining

Negative and violent
Negative and violent
Negative and violent
Negative and violent
We're all so important


How could we be so damn gullible?
It shows just how greedy we all can be
To be persuaded by such an obvious scheme
The thought of fortunes blind us from our common sense

And in return
And in return we get bankruptcy and distress
And abundance of black money that's impossible to be cleaned

Since 1996 they have ripped off savings from our families
Destroying lives and industries
But you just laugh and dance at our ignorance
But it's reasons like these that make the world a disgrace

No players in your game anymore
No winners or losers, we are both pathetic
We are both pathetic
You go chop their dollar
You go chop their dollar
But all the money you take will still make you worth nothing


You claim to be this false identity
But I can only see a villain, an enemy
Get off your knees, it shouldn't matter if you believed
Spit down the throat of the man that made you and laugh 
In the face of the man that saved you

Break the needle from its eye
Did you think that you would pass through?
You fucking know
Separate the blood from its lover and the romance dies too

I see you laugh when you pray
I see no virtue in the words that you say
I've questioned your faith for days and days
Born again but you can't be saved 

You spread the word because you think that you must living by the words
"In God we trust" but we don't trust you 

You can cash your checks from the good book so you can buy yourself a crown
Just sign your name on the cross and turn it upside down 

Liars, thieves, villains, enemies 

Set your wings that have carried you this far to flames 

Spit down the throat of the man that made you and laugh in the face of the man that saved you 

Break the needle from its eye
Did you think that you would pass through?
You fucking know

Separate the blood from its lover and the romance dies too

If that white light would shine brighter
Than I'd love to watch you burn


There's always something trying to keep me down
Every day, same hour, some voice is calling me, calling me
Further from happiness, I'm losing my fucking mind
Wishing I was closer to ending this

And not a, not a day goes by where I don't see
Numbers going up and credit scores follow me
Haunting my future in building my name

So far behind and it, it makes me sick to think
That the world revolves around debt
I can't seem to shake this, so far behind on everything

Feeding at the hands of the ones that put me out
And I can't seem to shake this, so far behind on everything
And I can't seem to shake this

Haunting my future in building my name
And don't get shit twisted and end up in our shoes
Haunting my future, some things will never change
Some things will never change

Scraping at the very bottom
Wishing I was closer to ending this

Blegh!

Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me
Calling me


(Set)
I can't complain, I left the world
Every sign is proving it
I'm killing it, we're killing it
We're always
Oh yeah

I can't complain I left the world
You could complain, I turned my back on you 

Am I leaving this?
Is this the end of it?
Yeah, am I leaving this?
Is this the end of it?
I'm through 

I'm gone
I'm staying gone
I'm staying gone
I'm staying gone
I'm staying gone


We all heard it
Your collision with the sofa bed
That set off one hundred thousand car alarms
There's nothing left
There's nothing left of me
You're withering away
You're getting lost in your systematic extraction

What once was clear, has now disappeared
And you'll keep playing
And I'll keep thinking
"Hour by hour, hours spent" 
"Hour by hour, hours spent" 
"Hour by hour, hours spent" 

It's the type of thing, cannot be kissed and made better


Dead hands clutch my arm,
The smell of death fills the air,
Her fragrance, her carcass reanimates,
If you need me I'll be tying a rope to the tree,
Where our, where our love used to be,
I've took down every photo of us, and buried them at sea,
I've took down every photo, and I buried them at sea,

Don't worry sweetie,
Beauty is only skin deep,

Psyche!

Your beauty is no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore?
Oh, your beauty is no, no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you stupid fucking whore?

"I should have know, not to look into her eyes,
I'm cast to stone, her glare was my demise."
Medusa,
Medusa,

Oh, your beauty is no, no more,
So why don't you just fuck yourself you fucking whore?

Dead hands clutch my arm,
The smell of death, it fills the air,
Her fragrance, her carcass reanimates,

Since you left me, (I've never)
Since you left me, (been the same)
Since you left me, (I've never)
Since you left me, (been the fucking same)

Go,

Hour by hour, day by day,
Your memory will fade away,
Every sunrise, every sunset,
Will help me to forget,
Your name, your smile,
Your eyes - Medusa,

Decapitate her and bring her head to Athena,
Unlike her sisters, she ain't no deathless God,

This is for every time you stabbed me in the back,
For every notch in your bed post,
This is for every time you stabbed me in the back,
For every notch in your bed post,
Bed post,


So cash in all your chips tonight baby, cuz were going out of style.
We could leave this city, if only for a while.
Well take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed.
No one can know about this.
The only place ill ever call home, is my deathbed.

I know were so wrong, but it feels so right.
And its not a party, if it happens every night.
I'm running on empty, your running out of luck.
So lets ditch this city, before we sober up


Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out alive.
Let's play a game of Russian Roulette.
I'll load the gun, you place the bets.
Tell me who will make it out alive.

Over, and over, and over again.
We play the same old games.
Cards kept close to my chest:
That way the secret's kept.
So wear your poker face.
Here's to the fool, here's to the thief.
Fiction is bitter and you got a taste.

My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.
My alligator blood is starting to show.
I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.

Cut me up and wear my skin.
Show me how to live.
Tear me down, clean me up.
Now spill my fucking guts.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.
Just help me find a way.

My alligator blood is starting to show.

Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.

I know that you know that I know that you know.
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand.

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the walls.

Now you know.

Now you know, you can go.
You can give up trying.
Should have just called it quits.

Leave before it's too late.

Alive.

Blegh.
Yeah!

So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my fucking brain.

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brain.
Put a gun to my head and paint the fucking walls. 


I've lost the plot again
Tell your friends to sharpen their teeth
There's a few quid to be made

And my soul's a sorry state
So come on down, you're empty lovers.
Worms come out of the woodwork
And the snakes start to sing.

Do you feel the chill,
Clawing at the back of your neck?
I start to spill,
Did you really think that you could fix me?
They'll sell your bones for another roll.
We'll sharpen your teeth.
Tell yourself that it's just business.

Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches come from out of the dirt.
Rats come out of the holes they call home,
I fall apart.
And the snakes start to sing.

Don't say I'm better off dead,
Cause heaven's full and hell won't have me.
Won't you make some room in your bed?
Well you could lock me up in your heart,
And throw away the key.
Won't you take me out of my head?

I'm just a would've been, could've been,
Should've been, never was and never ever will be.
We'll sharpen your teeth.
Tell yourself that it's just business.
Would've been, could've been,
Should've been, never was, and never ever will be.
Worms come out of the woodwork,
And the snakes start to sing.

Worms come out of the woodwork.
Leeches come from out of the dirt.
Rats come out of the holes they call home,
I fall apart.
And the snakes start to sing.

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection,
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armor?
The apple of your eye?
Or just a step to climb?

If you can't soar with the eagles
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting high?
Did you catch your own reflection
In the knife my mother held?
Or the hell in my father's eyes?

If you can't soar with the eagles,
Then don't fly with the flock.
Are you still getting by?
Was I your knight in shining armor?
Or the apple of your eye?
Or just a step, a fucking step, to climb!


This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to attend
Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay
I hate to say I told you so, but fuck it, I told you so
Don't say a word, I already know

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone call an exorcist and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleeding and it's only getting worse
This happens all the time
This happens every day
But I never seem to quit
The wolves never stay at bay

I hate to say I told you so, but fuck it, I told you so
Don't say a word, I already know (I already know)

This is an anthem, so fucking sing (so fucking sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of giving in
Yeah, get the fuck up
This is it
The end of everything
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
I've come back to old remedies

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
This is an anthem, so fucking sing

This is an anthem, so fucking sing
A dedication to the end of everything

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything

The world's in the shit and your children are fucked
The ones you think got you are out for your blood
Well, the lines are blurred and washed out with spite
So what exactly do you think you're going to change?

United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
We're fucked, but you're making it worse.
United we'll fail
Divided we'll fall
Give up, 'cause you're making it so much worse

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything

Give me a break, you deluded arrogant fuck
Self-savvy prick
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your seat and onto the street
There will be no peaceful revolution,
No war without blood
You can say I'm just a fool who stands for nothing
Well for that, I say you're a cunt

Kick it

United we'll fail
Divided, we'll fall
United, we'll fail
We're fucked, but you're making it worse

Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
I've seen the devil swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck

Every single thing I've said.

You think you're changing anything?
Quit saying anything


Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no it's not a phase 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find

'Cause I'm going out, I'll fake what's real
Can anyone respond?

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

Am I broken, what's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe

It's like an avalanche
I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under

I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world

I'm going out, I'll fake what's real
Can anyone respond?

It's like an avalanche

'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance
My heart is frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under

I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause when it hits, well, it hits like an avalanche


I guess some kids are just born with tragedy in their blood.
I try to wash this away. 
I wanna cleanse your veins.

I can help you see the light out of your despair.
You tie the rope, I'll kick the fucking chair.

I feel the malice in my veins.
My heart swells with hatred in your name.
And when you've got nothing to turn black and blue.
You've still got Hell to look forward to.

You've still got Hell.
You've still got Hell.
Well, you've still got Hell.

I will dance on your grave.
I will dance on your fucking grave.
I will dance on your grave.
I will dance on your grave.

Oh, when you're blessed with a grave to call your own,
in my mind you'll be six feet closer to your home.
Your eulogy will be music.
Your eulogy will be music to my ears.

Oh, yeah!

I can help you to see light out of your despair.
You tie the rope, I'll kick the fucking chair.

I feel the malice in my veins.

You've still got Hell,
you've still got Hell to look forward to.

Black and blue!
Black and blue!

I have never really fucking cared.
She never fucking, had fucking air.
I have never really fucking cared.
Tie the rope, I'll kick the fucking chair.
Let's go!

So just like that you're fucking dead and gone.
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long.
We built an empire and you took the throne.
But, you built it from bayonets and sat there alone.
I hope your Queen was worth it.
Do you still serve her on your knees?
Because you say when the world was at your feet,
Just slept while we lived the dream.
You won't miss the water until the rivers run dry.
You won't miss the sunset until it burns out the sky.
You won't miss what you have until it's finally lost.
But, you don't miss a bastard when you're bearing his fucking cross.
Blacklist.
Nothing, but a blacklist.
With friends like you there's no need for enemies.
With friends like you there's no need for anything.
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist.
Well, truth be told I'm a little bit gutted.
I mean, you were always a prick, but we still seemed to love you.
We started this together and it should have stuck.
But, there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck.
Well, I know I was a cunt in the final days.
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage.
To see someone not give a shit, despite of all of this.
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck.
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch.
You're on my blacklist and there's nothing left to say.
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight.


You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me

Ask no questions and you'll get no lies
Turn the cheek and blind the eye
Let it go
Bend the knee and give away your life
Bite your tongue and close your mind
Never know

'Cause you got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me

You're not blessed you're cursed
And it's getting worse now

It makes no sense but it must right
The blood and sweat you sacrificed
Was it all for nothing
'Cause you found no sign and see no light
We hear no voice when we pray at night
But we swore and now it's too late to turn back

You're not blessed you're cursed
And it's getting worse now

You got hell to pay but you already sold your soul
It's blasphemy
But the words don't make sense no more
What would your mother say, your faith that you ignored
So don't try to tell me that you still believe
No don't preach to me

No don't preach to me
Don't preach to me
No don't preach to me
It's blasphemy


Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you I was lying girl, it beats for two
Because I got your love and I got these vices
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you

Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you I was lying girl
I've been lying to you

Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me on my own

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, because 
Everything I touch turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me, and leave me, I can't hold on

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, every word I've said
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you


Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?

Can you help the hopeless?
Well, I'm begging on my knees
Can you save my bastard soul?
Will you ache for me?

I'm sorry brother
So sorry lover
Forgive me father
I love you mother

Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?

I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim
I'm scared to get close and I hate being alone
I long for that feeling to not feel at all
The higher I get, the lower I'll sink
I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim

Can you feel my heart?, can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?


They drag me underground
The lights are slowly fading
The world I thought I knew
I never knew at all

The dead don't make a sound
Unless you're chasing rainbows
And then they scream your name
Clawing at the gates

So pull me out 
And hold me down
Let's find a way 
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your room in
Paradise!

Are we just dreaming
In the city that never sleeps?
'Cause I can't be seeing
What my eyes tell me

Am I just dreaming?
This can't be in my veins
Everything I ever knew
Will never be the same

So chew me up, and spit me out
Let's find a way to save ourselves

So pull me out
And hold me down
Let's find a way
To lose ourselves

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your room in
Paradise!

And now I feel it.
Yeah I feel it in my blood!

I can't fight this anymore
I've given up!
I've given up!

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your room in

PARADISE!

Take me to the sun
I feel I'm chasing rainbows
And now I'm lost and I'm alone
Waiting for a chance to

Sink my teeth into
Another desperation
Now into your room in
Paradise!

Yeah!


I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

It sits in silence, eats away at me.
It feeds like cancer. This guilt could fill a fucking sea.
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door.
Now falling and failing is all I know.

This disease is getting worse.
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse.
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.
Yeah!
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night.
I'm buried and breathing in regret.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I may look happy, but honestly dear,
the only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear.
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed.
They lick their lips, as all the shame spills out of me.

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for...

Repent! Repent! The end is nigh!
Repent! Repent! We're all gonna die!
Repent! Repent! These secrets will kill us!
So get on your knees, and pray for forgiveness!

We all carry these things inside that no one else can see.
They hold us down like anchors. They drown us out at sea.
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see.
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

Ruh!

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you don't know.

I've got a secret.
It's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs.
And I'm gonna keep it.
I know something you will never know.
You will never know.
I know something you don't know.


Believe in no one!

Hallelujah, well I'm saved
Just a dozen steps and 28 days
It's a miracle, I'll be born again
With the Lord as my Shepard
I will find a way

Fuck your faith.
No one's gonna save you.
Fuck your faith.

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young
The crooked young

We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No death can touch the crooked young

Believe in no one!
But yourself!
The faceless won't save you
The clouds won't hear your fucking prayers.

There's no hope for us
We speak in tongues, blacker than the sun
No death can touch the crooked young

Hallelujah, I'm saved
It's a miracle, thank you Jesus
Hallelujah, I'm saved
Fuck your faith.
Fuck your faith.


Crucify me, nail my hands to a wooden cross
There is nothing above, there is nothing below
Heaven and Hell lives in all of us
And I have been cast astray

I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of rules could salvage me
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
I've been cast astray

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)

I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of rules could salvage me
Save yourself, save your breath
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death
So breathe for me, just breathe

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
And you say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
And you say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Yeah

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me


The sun goes down, we come out
The sun comes up, we come down
We lived fast and died pretty

"We're all vampires and we own this fucking night"

I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home
I've been walking these streets for days
In search of blood yeah.
I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
I'd do anything, oh anything

So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight
Until it breaks. You can't kill us
We'll never fucking die.
I want to sink my teeth into all of you
If only I could show you just how sweet this could be
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth
So spit it out, so spit it out


Eyes like a car crash,
I know I shouldn't look but I can't turn away.
Body like a whiplash,
Salt my wounds but I can't heal the way I feel about you.

I watch you like a hawk.
I watch you like I'm gonna tear you limb from limb.
Will the hunger ever stop?
Can we simply starve this sin?

That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul.
And like a deer in the headlights I meet my fate.
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard.
Tides will bring me back to you.

And on my deathbed, all I'll see is you.
The life may leave my lungs,
But my heart will stay with you...

That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul.
And like a ghost in the silence I disappear.
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard.
Tides will bring me back to you.

The waves will pull us under,
Tides will bring me back to you.
The waves will pull us under,
Tides will bring me back to you.
The waves will pull us under,
Tides will bring me back to you.
Tides will bring me back to you.

That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul.
And like a ghost in the silence I disappear.
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard.
Tides will bring me back to you.

That little kiss you stole, it held my heart and soul.
And like a deer in the headlights I meet my fate.
Don't try to fight the storm, you'll tumble overboard.
Tides will bring me back to you...


We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak

And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead

I refuse, I refuse
I refuse to close my eyes

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death

I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead

I have loved, and I have lost
I have turned, and I have tossed
I have listened, and I have watched
I've gave into this for long enough
I have lost, and I have loved
Sleep has stolen far too much
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death

So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever

So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever

I can promise you one thing, death will take us all
I can promise you one thing, you will die alone

We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie

We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead

I refuse, I refuse
I refuse to close my eyes


I was raised in the valley
There was shadows and death
Got out alive but with scars
I can't forget

This kid back in school
Subdued and shy
An orphan and a brother and unseen by most eyes
I don't know what it was that made a piece of him die
Took a boy to the forest
Slaughtered him with a scythe

Stamped on his face
An impression in the dirt
Do you think the silence
Makes a good man convert?

We all have our horrors
And our demons to fight
But how can I win when
I'm paralyzed?
They crawl up on my bed
Wrap their fingers round my throat
Is this what I get for
The choices that I made?

God forgive me for all my sins
God forgive me for everything
God forgive me for all my sins
God forgive me
God forgive me

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones
That haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself
So stay with me tonight
Don't go
Don't go

If I let you in
You'd just want out
If I tell you the truth
You'd vie for a lie
If I spilt my guts
It would make a mess
We can't clean up

If you follow me
You will only get lost
If you try to get closer
We'll only lose touch
Yes you already know too much
And you're not going anywhere

Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Tell me that you love me 'cause I need you so much
Tell me that you need me 'cause I love you so much
Say you'll never leave me 'cause I need you so much

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Save me from the ones
That haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself
So stay with me tonight

Don't go
I can't do this on my own
Don't go
Save me from the ones
That haunt me in the night
I can't live with myself
So stay with me tonight

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go


Don't look down!
Let's go!

You'll never take me,
You'll never win.
If I'm going down,
You're coming with me.
I'll never shut down,
I'll never sleep.
If I'm going down,
I'll take the world with me.

Yo,
The Devil's at your door,
You sold your soul,
Now he's coming back for more.
Don't fight it, it will only make it worse.
You signed the line,
You said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Don't look down!)
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Don't look down!)

The Devil's at your door.
(The Devil's at your door!)
You sold your soul,
Now he's coming back for more.
Don't fight, it'll only make it worse.
You signed the line,
You said the words.
Get ready for the end of everything.
(Shit, shit, shit!)
Get ready for the end of everything.

What have you done?
You've opened it now,
And I'm not sure there's anyway round.
Why do you run?
It's tripping me out,
And I don't know if I can keep up with you now.

The sky is falling,
The sun is burning,
A hole into our eyes.
The ground will open,
Like an ocean,
And swallow us alive.

You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!
You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!

Yo,
The Devil's at your door,
You sold your soul,
Now he's coming back for more.
Don't fight, it'll only make it worse.

Like an ocean,
And swallow us alive.

You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!
You say you swear to God,
Now swear to me!
Now swear to me!
Now swear to me!


Cut off my wings and come lock me up.
Just pull the plug yeah, I've had enough.
Tear me to pieces, sell me for parts.
You're all vampires so here, you can have my heart.

You can have my heart.
You can have my heart.
You can have my heart.

The world's a funeral, a room of ghosts.
No hint of movement, no sign of pulse.
Only an echo, just skin and bone.
They kicked the chair but we, we helped tie the rope.

You can have my heart.
You can have my heart.
You can have my heart.

So come rain on my parade cause I wanna feel it.
Come shove me over the edge cause my head is in overdrive.
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving.
So come rain on my parade...

I think we're doomed...
I think we're doomed...
And now there's no way back!

You must have made some kind of mistake.
I asked for Death but instead I'm awake.
The Devil told me: "No room for cheats".
I thought I sold my soul, but he kept the receipt.

So leave a light on, I'm coming home.
It's getting darker but I'll carry on.
The sun don't shine but it never did.
And when it rains it fucking pours but I think I like it.
And you know that I'm in love with the mess.
I think I like it!

So come rain on my parade cause I wanna feel it.
Come shove me over the edge cause my head is in overdrive.
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving.
So come rain on my parade...

I think we're doomed...
I think we're doomed...
And now there's no way back!

I think we're doomed...
I think we're doomed...
And now there's no way back!

So come rain on my parade cause I wanna feel it.
Come shove me over the edge cause my head is in overdrive.
I'm sorry but it's too late and it's not worth saving.
So come rain on my parade...

I think we're doomed...
I think we're doomed...
And now there's no way back!


I thought I saw your eyes, laced in smoke and cigarette curls.
I thought I saw your eyes, 
but I'm seeing ghosts tonight.

She haunts me, till my bitter end.
She haunts me.

I swear I heard your voice, overwhelmed by conversation.
I swear I heard your voice,
but I'm hearing ghosts tonight.
The bars turn out their lights,
and I drink away the day as it decays.

So much for living forever.
So much for death do us part.

She haunts me.
She haunts me.
She haunts me, every fucking night.


What doesn't kill you makes you wish you were dead.
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper and I can't take...
One more moment of this silence, 
The loneliness is haunting me.
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up.

It comes in waves I close my eyes,
Hold my breath and let it bury me.

I'm not okay and it's not alright.
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now,
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself. 
Don't let me drown.

Who will make me fight,
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself.
Don't let me drown.

What doesn't destroy you leaves you broken instead.
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper and I can't take...
One more moment of this silence, 
The loneliness is haunting me.
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up.

It comes in waves I close my eyes,
Hold my breath and let it bury me.

I'm not okay and it's not alright.
Won't you drag the lake and bring me home again?

Who will fix me now, 
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself. 
Don't let me drown.

Who will make me fight,
Drag me out alive?
Save me from myself.
Don't let me drown.

'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own.

'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own.

'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own.

'Cause you know that I can't do this on my own.

Who will fix me now?

Who will fix me now?

Who will fix me now,
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself.
Don't let me drown


It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
Are we truly alone?
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing

The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live while we learn, and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home
Come on

They came like moths to a flame
You live like a house in a hurricane

(The wolves are at my door)

It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
The end, are we truly alone?
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing

I hear them calling at the gates
(Let us in, let us in)
I hear them calling out my name (I don't care)

Let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let the bastards sing
Let the God-forsaken bastards sing

They came like moths to a flame
You live like a house in a hurricane

The wolves are at my door
But I can see the writing on the wall
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

It's the start of the end
Surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes

We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
The end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded
Let 'em sing, let 'em sing


Yeah

Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices, but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill everything and everyone?
Say you'll do it but never will

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

I am my father's son
He's a phantom, a mystery, and that leaves me nothing
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you've gotta do is get rid of me

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
Yeah

I tried, you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and you gave me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit, it's shit that you gave me

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in my head
It's all in your head
It's all in my head
Yeah

Oh

Do you wanna feel pain? Taking my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse the ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you
Better suck it up 'cause you bleed through
You better stay away from me
Stay the fuck away from me

I feel safe, seems you're saved
I feel safe, seems you're saved

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye

Mother fucker

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new


[Instrumental]


My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost.
I need to feel something cause I'm still so far from home.
Cross your heart and hope to die.
Promise me you'll never leave my side.

Show me what I can't see when the spark in my eyes is gone.
You got me on my knees I'm your one man cult.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Promise you I'll never leave your side.

Cause I'm telling you you're all I need.
I promise you you're all I see.
Cause I'm telling you you're all I need.
I'll never leave...

So you can drag me through Hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell.
And you can throw me to the flames.
I will follow you, I will follow you...

Come sink into me and let me breathe you in.
I'll be your gravity, you'll be my oxygen.
So dig two graves cause when you die,
I swear I'll be leaving by your side.

So you can drag me through Hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell.
And you can throw me to the flames.
I will follow you...

So you can drag me through Hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell.
And you can throw me to the flames.
I will follow you, I will follow you...
I will follow you, I will follow you...

So you can drag me through Hell,
If it meant I could hold your hand.
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell.
And you can throw me to the flames.
I will follow you, I will follow you...


why the fuck can i not hail a taxi?
arm out like a nazi - every cunt's driving past
where the fuck is everyone?
i can't see anyone. i can't see anything!

the hardest part of today is a hangover
empty bottles and empty promises
i got every person i need
and it's gonna be one hell of a messy night!
I can't remember last night. I can't remember anything!

"Party til you pass out, drink til' you're dead.
Dance all night til you can't feel your legs"
We are done with giving a fuck.


It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen.
The minutes are hours, the hours are days.
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tounges.
I smell the lies, dancing on your blackened lungs.

I whispered in her ear: 
"Fear me dear, for I am Death.
I'll take your hope, your dreams, your love
till there's nothing left."

I whispered in her ear: 
"You better fear me dear, for I am Death.
And I'll take that shit you call a life,
in a single fucking breath."

I'll take your hope.
I'll take your fucking dreams.
I'll take your love.
I'll take everything, you fucking bitch.

I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes.
I'll turn your promises into lies.
I'll steal the diamonds from your eyes.
I'll turn your promises into lies.

It's 3:18, mouth tastes like the corpse of every pregnant teen.
The hours are days, the days are dead.
I feel infected by your presence, you speak in tounges.
I smell the lies, dancing on your blackened lungs.

I hear the fear in your voice, but you shouldn't feel a thing.
Your life's already worse than any pain that I could bring.
That I could bring.
That I could bring.

I could make it December every day.
But you're so blind, it may as well be May.

And I whispered in her ear: 
"You better fear me dear, for this is Death."
And I whispered in her ear: 
"Fear me, 'cause I am Death."

One more time!

I whispered in her ear: 
"Fear me dear, for I am Death.
I'll take everything you ever loved."

I whispered in her ear: 
"You better fear me, for I am Death.
For I am Death.
For I am Death."

Bitch!


Let's fuck until the sun comes up.
Because we haven't got long, but we've got enough.
A night to remember, a day to forget.
(Don't stop until we pirouette.)
I'm no saint; you're no martyr.
One more night playing heart pinata.
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
The only way we know, the only way we know.
The only way we know, the only way we know.
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?

Let's fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Let's fuck until our hearts give up.
It won't be long.
It's hard to remember; I didn't forget.
If our eyes were diamonds then we'd be rich.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it quits on me.
Your voice makes my heart skip beats.
So, keep quiet before it flat lines.
Before it flat lines.

I'm dead.
Tell 'em all we're dead.
We can hold the wake right here in this bed.
Sunk into you; tangled in sheets.
Buried in blankets six foot deep.
I'm dead.
Kick it.

Fuck, fuck, fuck!

Let's fuck until the sun comes up.
Because we haven't got long, but we've got enough.
A night to remember, a day to forget.
(Don't stop until we pirouette.)
I'm no saint; you're no martyr.
One more night playing heart pinata.
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.

We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
(We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen!)
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads.
(So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads!)
We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen.
(We're young and in love, heart attacks waiting to happen!)
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words.
(So come a little closer, tell me those three little words!)


For the love of god, will you bite your tongue
Before we make you swallow it
It's moments like this where silence is golden...
...and then you speak.

No one wants to hear you
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
I'm begging you to spare me
The pleasure of your company

When did the diamonds leave your bones?

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

(Go to hell, for heaven's sake)

No one wants to hear you (Save your breath)
No one wants to see you
So desperate and pathetic
You think that no one sees this
I think it's time you knew the truth

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

When did the diamonds leave your bones?
Leave your bones!

You're not a shephard, you're just a sheep
A combined effort of everyone you meet
You're all flesh with no bone.
Feed them to the sharks and throw 'em to the wolves!

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

I'm burning down every bridge we make
I'll watch you choke on the hearts you break
I'm bleeding out every word you said
Go to hell for heaven's sake

Go to hell for heaven's sake!
Go to hell for heaven's sake!
Go to hell for heaven's sake!


S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
Let's go!

I've had enough
There's a voice in my head
Says I'm better off dead

But if I sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
I'll be alright

You want to give up
Gave it all that you've got and it still doesn't cut

But if you sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
You'll be just fine 'cause

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it
S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it

We are possessed
We're all fucked in the head
Alone and depressed

But if we sing along
A little fucking louder to a happy song
Maybe we'll forget 'cause

Every now and again we get that feeling
And the great big void inside us opens up
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

Don't wake us up, we'd rather just keep dreaming
'Cause the nightmares in our heads are bad enough
And I really wish that you could help
But my head is like a carousel
And I'm going round in circles
I'm going round in circles

The world has coalesced
Into one giant mess
Of hate and unrest
So let's all sing along
A little goddamn louder to a happy song
And pretend it's all ok

Let's go!

So sing along
Let's sing along
A little fucking louder
A little fucking louder
Well, don't you feel so much better?

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it (well, that's the spirit)

S.P.I.R.I.T.
Spirit, let's hear it (yeah, that's the spirit)


Cross my heart I don't want to die
But heaven knows it seems like I try
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end
I live and I learn from my mistakes
Then forget them again

Got a feeling in my stomach and it just won't quit
As subtle as a shotgun and as heavy as a brick
'Cause I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is
He's a lot more familiar than I care to admit

If only I could focus
Maybe if I could see
If I didn't know any better
I would say he looks just like me

The roof is crashing down
The walls are caving in
We've discovered all your stories
Are just works of fiction
The roof is crashing down
The truth is spilling out

(Oh, shit) I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh) I've crossed the line
(No) So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
(Oh, shit) I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh) I've crossed the line
(No) So many times
I don't even know what it stands for

Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you say
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you say

Got a feeling in my stomach that just won't quit
As subtle as a shotgun, as heavy as a brick
Bite your tongue, just bite your tongue
You've already said quite enough

Another roof is crashing down
The walls are caving in
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction
The roof is crashing down
The truth is spilling out

(Oh, shit) I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh) I've crossed the line
(No) So many times
I don't even know what it stands for
(Oh, shit) I've done it again
I'm way too far in over my head
(Oh) I've crossed the line
(No) So many times
I don't even know what it stands for

You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair and let's be done with it
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair, so kick the chair

You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair and let's be done with it
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair, so kick the chair

Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you say
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole
Just be careful what you say


And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even Hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get, it's always there when you come back down.
The funny thing is all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of Heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make
With the love I feel, 
I just had to start again...

The days are a death-wish
A witch-hunt for an exit
I am powerless

The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless

Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless

Everybody wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die
I can't fear death no longer
I've died a thousand times

Why explore the universe,
When we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads,
That no-one dares to dwell...

Throw me to the flames
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze
Watch me burn

How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me, what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?

Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls

Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls


never mind this is bye straight reads the line anybody know how to delete this shit?


It started off with a one night stand and lingered to a fling
I'm sorry to all the soldiers who didn't see me as a fake
All you feel and all you want you still need your blood
Talons raised different now you're up to no good
(Take my hand show me the way, heal all the children
They are great. Take my hand show me the way, heal all
The children that make me sing)

One more nail in the coffin, one more for the grave
One more time I'm on my knees trying to walk away
How has it come to this

I've said it once, I've said it twice,
I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm ok that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
It's not just your alone with me its just you'll never leave
[I've said it once I've said it twice I've said it a
Thousand fucking times]

You said it's a suicide and I say this is a war,
When I rode into battle.
Battle, this is oh.
This is what you call love.
This is our war, our cause.

One more nail in the coffin, one more for the grave
One more time I'm on my knees trying to walk away.
Everything I loved, is nearly everything I've lost

I've said it once, I've said it twice,
I've said it a thousand fucking times
That I'm ok that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
It's not your just alone with me its just you'll never leave
It's not your just alone with me its just you'll never leave!

Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends


Goodbye my friend, goodbye
My love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
We're united by and by, united by and by
Goodbye
No handshake to endure, there was nothing

[Chorus]
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood

Inside no sadness, for a prowl
As nothing new lay dying now
Inside no sadness, for a prowl
And nothing new lay dying now

And it was written in blood

It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written, in blood
On a suicide note

Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We fall apart (Die)
We fall apart (Die)

Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses
We've fallen apart, fallen apart

It was written in blood
On a fucking suicide note
The night before he died

[Chorus]

Like roses, we blossom and die
Like roses, we blossom and die
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
Fallen apart
We've fallen

These roses, white roses
Roses
My roses
White roses


I know I bend and I break all my promises, 
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.

Are you sick, are you tired, are you feeling faint?
Your lips are turning blue.
I know you wish you were dead to the world, 
But there's something you should know.

You're scared, I can see you tremble, 
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger, 
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 

Do you wish that you could cut yourself out of your skin?
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 
Whatever the fuck it takes to feel like you fit in?
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 

Life is a song with no one to dance to, 
Same old shit happening and nobody knows.
My heart is a dead horse, there's no point in beating, 
Just let me sink, let me sink into the fucking ground.

Fuck it.

You're scared, I can see you tremble, 
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger, 
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 

Do you think you're the only one who feels the way you do?
We're all fifty shades of fucked up! 
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 

I know I bend and I break all my promises, 
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.
I know I bend and I break all my promises, 
But now it's time for the truth.
I keep my head in the clouds and I hope
That I can't just be invisible to you.

You're scared, I can see you tremble, 
Shaking like a dog, shitting razor blades.
Feel love shadows like a stranger, 
Well join the club, yeah, join the club! 

Do you think you're the only one who feels the way you do?
We're all fifty shades of fucked up! 
Well join the club, yeah, join the club!


I thought I saw your eyes, 
Laced in smoke and cigarette curls,
I thought I saw your eyes, 
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight,

She haunts me, 
Till my bitter end,
She haunts me, 

I swear I heard your voice,
Overwhelmed by conversation,
I swear I heard your voice,
But I'm hearing ghosts,

Tonight, the bars turn out their lights,
And I drink away the day as it decays,

So much for living forever, 
So much for death do us part,

She haunts me,
She haunts me,
She haunts me every fucking night,


I thought I saw your eyes, 
Laced in smoke and cigarette curls,
I thought I saw your eyes, 
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight,

She haunts me, 
Till my bitter end,
She haunts me, 

I swear I heard your voice,
Overwhelmed by conversation,
I swear I heard your voice,
But I'm hearing ghosts,

Tonight, the bars turn out their lights,
And I drink away the day as it decays,

So much for living forever, 
So much for death do us part,

She haunts me,
She haunts me,
She haunts me every fucking night,


I thought I saw your eyes, 
Laced in smoke and cigarette curls,
I thought I saw your eyes, 
But I'm seeing ghosts tonight,

She haunts me, 
Till my bitter end,
She haunts me, 

I swear I heard your voice,
Overwhelmed by conversation,
I swear I heard your voice,
But I'm hearing ghosts,

Tonight, the bars turn out their lights,
And I drink away the day as it decays,

So much for living forever, 
So much for death do us part,

She haunts me,
She haunts me,
She haunts me every fucking night,


[Instrumental]


For people like your, there is no such thing as an early grave.
Your wanted to gut my dreams til I was empty, and show everyone my remains.

"And after everything you put me through, I should of fucking pissed on you"


I've been taken from your arms so many times,
I've felt this before,
The sheets are tangled, 
And they don't feel right on my carcass like you do,

This is my revenge, 
And this is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,

(Gin-gin-gin)

I feel dead, I feel dead inside,
I feel dead, I feel so fucking dead,
I feel dead,
I, feel so dead,

Last night, we dressed to our best,
And drank till there was nothing left,
I walked you home, you held my hand,
We fucked away the rest of the night,

Take my hand,
For this is my revenge,
This is your demise,
For every second lost,
I

This is my revenge, 
This is my revenge,
This is my revenge,
This is my
This is my revenge,
This is my
(For every second sleep has stole)

And sweetie, I've got to say,
That I'm really not worth the time of your day,
I guess when we left each other for the first time,
We didn't think "goodbye" would be our new favorite line


You don't have to lie, I know exactly where you've been 
Cause you're chewing off my ear while you're chewing on your chin 

No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now - I think it's time to pack it in

Don't call it a party, 'cuz it never stops
No one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me I'm happy, 'cuz this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for (So be careful what you wish for)

Who you trying to fool you know you're in over your head
'Cuz you're holding on to heaven but you're hanging by a thread

No we're not on the level, you're just off your face
It's not a state of mind though, your head's just in a state
I may be on the outside, but you're empty within
It's getting kind of old now - I think it's time to pack it in

Don't call it a party, 'cuz it never stops
No one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me I'm happy, 'cuz this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for (So be careful what you wish for)

Don't call it a party, 'cuz it never stops
No one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me I'm happy, 'cuz this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for

Don't call it a party, 'cuz it never stops
No one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me I'm happy, 'cuz this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for

Don't call it a party, 'cuz it never stops
No one is too many, but it's never enough
Don't tell me I'm happy, 'cuz this isn't love
So be careful what you wish for


She starts her new diet of liquor and dick.
Just like Hollywood, but laced in sick.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
The sun goes down, and so does she.

Sold out the love that she had, left with a cut of the throat.
Drinks all 'round on her before she strolls to the moat.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
The sun goes down, and so does she.

Oh!
Count!

Count your fucking blessings!
Come on!

Count your blessings, 'cause I'm counting every lie.
Count your blessings, 'cause I'm counting every lie.
Counting every lie.

Christ, I'm asking you for just one thing.
I'm asking you for just one thing.

Eradicate this disease.

Close your eyes, pray for plagues.
Oh Lord cleanse this Earth, and bring upon our dooms day.
Oh, close your eyes, pray for plagues.
Cleanse this Earth, and bring dooms day.

She starts her new diet of liquor and dick.
Just like Hollywood, but laced in sick.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
The sun goes down, and so does she.

So clap your hands to the sound of every first born dying now.
Watch the rivers flow with blood, death will stand where life once stood.

So clap your hands to the sound of every first born dying now.
Watch the rivers turn to blood, death will stand where life once stood.
So clap your hands to the sound of every first born dying now.
Watch this rivers turn to blood, death will stand where life once stood.

Close your eyes, pray for plagues.
Cleanse this Earth, bring our dooms day.


Yeah,
Rawwwwrr,

Take it back, what you suffer me,
Take it back, what you suffer me, baby,
Take it back, what you suffer me,
Take it back, what you suffer me, baby,

Taking back, what you stole from me,
Taking back, what you stole from me, baby

Taking back, what you stole
Taking back, what you stole from me

So

Wash away these memories, silent and proud,
Wash away these memories, silent and proud

Blood won't confirm on these curtains.
Your blood, my hands,
Your blood, my fucking hands

Run for the hills,
Your strength, from the dead afar,
Run for the hills,
Your strength from luck, cut this off,

And if you think you're alive,
Then you're better off fucking dead,

Right!

This will be, another moment where we put
Salt in my eyes, in wake I won't
Salt in my eyes
In hope I won't see your smile
I will not see her

This will be over my dead body
This will be over my dead body
This will be over my dead body
This will be over my dead body
This will be over my dead body
This will be over my dead body


And I've been dragging the lake for dead kids,
While you were sleeping,
Crossing away the calendar,
Rotting away, into the ground,

Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,

Die

I don't know what they said,
They all left me for dead,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
For now

You,

And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,

So nail the casket one more time,

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,
Now

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, you know it won't, baby,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, forever more,

Yeah,
Go, go,

Forever

Do not change the subject,
Let's go chase the sunset,
Bring me the horizon,
Bring me the horizon,
Now,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, it won't last forever,
So nail the casket,
Now
I

I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
Never forgive them,
Never forgive friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends


My heart's a hieroglyph, it talks in tongues
Ten thousand voices fill my broken lungs
But through the white wave, I still hear it call

So take a deep breath, let's disappear
No one will listen so why are we still here
And in the black hole you will see it

'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
So let's run

Your hand's a hurricane, it moves in waves
A perfect storm that keeps you wide awake
But through the silence, you will feel it, babe

So take my hand and let's away
You know there's nothing here to make us stay
And in the darkness you will see the sun

'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run away 'cause everything's broken
And we're so much more than another brick in the grave
So give me your every, give me your everything
And let's get away
'Cause everything's broken
I know that we're more than another brick in the grave
So give me your every, give me your everything

It's not enough
It's not enough

'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run

'Cause this is not enough
And I won't wait for them to cut me up
So give me all you've got
They'll never stop until they see us fall
So let's run
So let's run
So let's run


Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the d'j' vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before...

Are we close enough?
There is something I must confide
I think we've lost our touch
There's no sparkle in those eyes

What an awful mess I've made
There's nothing left to say

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the d'j' vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before...

There's nothing in the air tonight.
(Nothing in the air, tonight...)
There's nothing in the air tonight.
(Nothing in the air, tonight...)
There's nothing in the air tonight.
(Nothing in the air, tonight...)
There's nothing in the air tonight.
(Nothing in the air, tonight...)

Every second's soaked in sadness
Every weekend is a war
And I'm drowning in the d'j'  vu
We've seen it all before

I don't wanna do this by myself
I don't wanna live like a broken record
I've heard these lines a thousand times
And I've seen it all before...

I'm sorry, love. It's not enough
We should feel the love so painfully
It hurts right to the touch
I know it stings, I know this cuts
And I wish I could agree with you
But this love, it's not enough
It's not enough
It's not enough


Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where

Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where

I thought I'd buried you
And covered the tracks
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands
I thought I'd buried you
We're sinking, never die

I thought I cut you loose
Severed the feeling
I stepped through the crack as you clamp to my shirt
I thought I'd buried you
We're sinking, never die

Can you tell from the look in her eyes
We're going no where
We live our life like we're ready to die
We're going no where.

You can run but you'll never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where

This is sempiternal

Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over, again and again

Rise from the dead you child
Secrets don't deplete till they come to the ground
Signal the sirens, rally the troops
Ladies and gentlemen
Its the moment of truth

Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where

You can run but never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where

Can you tell from the look in her eyes?
We're going no where
We live our lives like we're ready to die
We're going no where

You can run but never escape
Over and over again
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where

This is sempiternal

Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal
Over and over, again and again


Show me how to kill you. 
You shed light then she'll get all broken.
Hurry up and get home my dear, where the fuck you been?
Can't you take a purpose with the shape of a better sin?
You're so fucking contradicting.

The clones come back on the bridal day.

The clones come back on the bridal day.
The clones come back on the bridal day.
The clones come back.
The clones come back.
The clones come back on the bridal day.
The clones come back on the bridal day.

The clones come back.

"Put on your best dress", the words you awaited.
"Put on your best fucking dress", the words you awaited.

Why can't you just... 

You're better leagued, and I try to grab your body.
To drag your gravestone.
To drag your gravestone.

Just leave it all fucking alone. 
I shall kill your murdered soul.

I will dance on your grave.
I will dance on your grave.


Fuck you!

You, took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You, bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you came for now leave, like vultures

Ripped apart in minutes, what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back, may as as well of disappeared
For as long as I remember you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, your on your fucking own

Sleep with one eye open
(Because)
Sleep with one eye open, cunt!

If I had it my way id slit your throat
With the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world fucking falling apart mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at you feet
You've got hell to pay, yea you've got hell to pay
You better fucking bow, bow down to me, you better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees, and cry me a fucking river

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever, cunt!


My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Sing it!

Time stood still 
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking

Wake up
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again

Time stands still (time stands still)
Time stands still (time stands still)

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking 

(It's like I'm sleepwalking)
(It's like I'm sleepwalking) 
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)

Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking


[Instrumental]


We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

No time for farewells, no chances for goodbyes.
No explanations, no fucking reasons why.
I watched it eat you up, pieces falling on the floor.
We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home again.
Don't give up hope, my friend, this is not the end.

We stare at broken clocks, the hands don't turn anymore.
The days turn into nights, empty hearts and empty places.
The day you lost him, I slowly lost you too.
For when he died, he took a part of you.

Death is only a chapter, so let's rip out the pages of yesterday.
Death is only a horizon. And I'm ready for the sun, I'm ready for the sun, to set.

This Is Suicide Season!

If only sorrow could build a staircase, or tears could show the way.
We would climb our way to heaven, and bring him home again.

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
We would climb our way back to heaven, and bring him home again.

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
We would climb our way to heaven, and bring him home again.

This is Suicide Season. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
We would climb my way to heaven, and bring him back home again. [x2]

If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
We would climb our way to heaven, and bring him back home again. [x3]

We would do anything to bring him back to you.
We would do anything to end what you're going through.
If only sorrow could build a staircase, our tears could show the way.
I would climb my way to heaven, and bring him home again.
I would do anything to bring him back to you.
Because if you got him back, I would get back the friend that I once knew.


I've been away for every day and every fucking night,
I've seen your eyes, I've seen your eyes,
I've seen your eyes for every day and every fucking night,
And with every city, it gets harder

You've got a mouth like a razor-blade, it cuts so deep,
So kiss my wrists and my neck, give me eternal sleep

You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away
But for me, this distance is decay

So line my throat with lipstick, and leave my blood for flies,
I'll gurgle the blues under a sea of lies

Before you take me to the sea, let me kiss the bride
Before you take me to the sea, let me kiss the bride

Now take my body to the shore and I'll wait for the tide
Now take my body to the shore and I'll wait for the tide

I will always love you! 
But I need pills to sleep
I have always failed you! 
So throw away my memories

Move!

I will always love you! 
But I need pills to sleep
I have always failed you!
So throw away my memories
Throw away, away
So throw away my memories
Throw them all away


Urrgggh!

Here I am, once again. Just like a pack of wolves.
The skies were once paved with gold, now they rain on us all.
I've made my bed, so I'll lie in it. 
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it. 

"Tell all my friends I said goodbye, lenched teeth and fluttering eyes"
I can't go on like this.
"Tell all my friends I said goodbye, lenched teeth and fluttering eyes"
I can't go on like this.

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something. 
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that it's getting harder just to feel alive.
It's getting harder just to feel alive.

Curtains close; take a bow. I think we fooled all of them now.
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day.
I've made my bed, so I'll lie in it. 
I've dug my grave, so God help me die in it.

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something. 
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that... 
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something. 
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...

And I dug my grave, so I'll lie in it. (Lie in it, lie in it)
I've made my bed, so I'll die in it. (Die in it)
I dug my grave
I dug my grave

I'd rather live, than live forever!

I'm knocking on Death's door, but you're already dead.
It's either now, or fucking never. 
And that night, we meant every word we said.
All I can say...
All I can say for sure is, we're coming out tonight.
All I can say for sure is, we're coming up tonight.

Just like the living dead,
Just like the living dead,
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something.
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that...

Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something. 
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that... 
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something. 
And I don't want it, I just need it.
And I can't believe that it's getting harder just to feel alive.
It's getting harder just to feel alive.


My eyes are shut for now it seems the only way that I can cope. 
A glittering example of what we've become. 
So grab yourself by the wrist and think about this twice 
One mistake could be the last action that you make. 
Now I'm on m knees, I can feel my spirit leaving me. 

I chose to promise myself that I'd never let you down. 
To capture this moment would be the best idea yet. 

Cowering in the dark. This room is now my friend. 
I'll stay here and wait it out until the pressure ends. 
I can't wait!!! Everything around me is a test to see I can last. 
I don't know if I can. Where's my strength at? 
I made a promise to myself that I'd always be around. 
I should capture this moment, before I let you down. 

I'm sure that I'll be heard, 
I've got too much to lose to fly away and leave all of this behind. 
So capture this moment, before I forget why I'm here. 

I'm killing the only person in life I thought I knew. 
The only person left to blame for this is you! 
I've got things to say that I know you want to hear. 
I can see through you perfectly clear. 

Don't go too far. I chose to stay here. Remind me where we are.


You said you can't get to heaven unless you get high
But there's no word of hell on the way back down
You said it's now or never,
You only live once

Would you be so quick to walk over to my grave?
You said you'll never be younger than you are tonight
Now I've never felt weaker in all my life
You said it's only a one off, only a line
But now it's a circle, all of the time
Well, it's a one man cult and he's serving his line
It's a "Lust For Life" but it's a lifeless wine
He kissed her hand and then he found out her name,
It's Death and now he can't seem to wake

You can't run with the foxes and yet hunt with the wolf

Are you addicted?
Tell me the truth

I think I'm losing my mind

They say the poison's in the dosage and they must be right
Left with panic attacks and death riding our backs
It all looks so much worse on the way back down
I'm so fucked up since I hit the ground

Revive me


Show me a sign, show me a reason to give
A solitary fuck about your god damn beliefs
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation you'll fear

Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick

What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse
Cloak and daggers murder the truth
The bitter taste, there's nothing else
I'll bow for your king when he shows himself

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

Show me your face, show me a reason to think,
My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins
I'm going blind, but one thing's clear
Death is the only salvation for me

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

The house wolves you built
The house wolves you built
(The nest of animals you built) 
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is 2 foot wide and 6 foot deep

And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep
And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see
Is two foot wide and six foot deep

Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Whispers in a thousand tongues

Brick by brick by brick
These walls begin to cave in
The house of wolves you built
Will burn just like a thousand suns

You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
You said you want me
Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here


Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this
And dear, I fear
That this ship is sinking tonight

I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself

Our legs begin to break
We've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache
But still we carry on
I'm choking on my words
Like I got a noose around my neck

I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear, dear I fear
I'm not coming home tonight
I'm not coming home tonight
'Cause dear I fear
This ship is sinking
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us?
Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure

Close your eyes
There's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past
Like it's six feet under

I won't give up on you
These scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me
It's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself 
I'll save you from yourself 
I'll save you from yourself 
I'll save you from yourself 

Try to numb the pain
With alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fucking feet
With a substance as a crutch

[Repeat: x2]
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you
We'll play this symphony of sympathy


And I've been dragging the lake for dead kids,
While you were sleeping,
Crossing away the calendar,
Rotting away, into the ground,

Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,
Where you belong,

Die

I don't know what they said,
They all left me for dead,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
God can have his way,
For now

You,

And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,
And when I'm done,
God can have his way with me,

So nail the casket one more time,

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,
Now

Nail the casket one more time,
I'm ready to go, baby,
Nail the casket one more time,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, you know it won't, baby,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, forever more,

Yeah,
Go, go,

Forever

Do not change the subject,
Let's go chase the sunset,
Bring me the horizon,
Bring me the horizon,
Now,

Twist the knife, it won't last forever,
Twist the knife, it won't last,
Forever, it won't last forever,
So nail the casket,
Now
I

I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends,
Never forgive them,
Never forgive friends,
I hate all my friends,
I hate all my friends


Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothing could take the pain away

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

The sticks and the stones that
You used to throw have
Built me an empire
So don't even try
To cry me a river
'Cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know
I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne

So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne


This is what the edge of your seat was made for,
Holding on, nothing to lose,
This is what the edge of your seat was made for,
And this,

This is what the back of your hand was made for,
Stolen apologies,
Stolen apologies, you,

You're a traitor to my heart,
You're a traitor to us all,

Forsaken,

This over indulgence of conciseness,
Has torn a day apart,
And lingered in the splendor,
Of the feeling in my stomach,
Trailing down the shadow of cupped hands,
Covering my face,
I wait for what I have to do,

Forsaken,

We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,
We're all movie stars,

(And I'm speaking these words)
(And I'm talking to the mirror)

You're a traitor to my heart,
You're a traitor to us fucking all,

I don't want to kiss anyone,
I don't want to kiss anyone but you,
I fucking love you


I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front
It's funny how
Things work out
Such a bitter irony
Like a kick right to the teeth
It fell apart
Right from the start
But I couldn't even see
The forest for the trees
(I'm afraid you asked for this)
You got a lot of nerve
But not a lot of spine
You made your bed
When you worried about mine
This ends now
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
It's kind of sad
'Cause what we had
Well it could of been something
I guess it wasn't meant to be
So how dare you
Try and steal my flame
Just 'cause yours faded
Well hate is gasoline
A fire fueling all my dreams
(I'm afraid you asked for this)
You got a lot of nerve
But not a lot of spine
You made your bed
When you worried about mine
This ends now

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front
I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

You can run
But you can't hide
Time won't help you
'Cause karma has no deadline

You can run
But you can't hide
Time won't help you
'Cause karma has no deadline

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
'Cause I'll forget but I'll never forgive you
Don't you know, don't you know?
True friends stab you in the front

I wouldn't hold my breath if I was you
You broke my heart and there's nothing you can do
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front

And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front
And now you know, now you know
True friends stab you in the front


This is a Call to arms, So grab your guns and get your horses
Only the dead have seen the end of this fight.
This is a Call to arms, so all you fallen soldiers sing with me,
Death or Glory 

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us.
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long.
All is fair in war or so they tell me
All is fair in war or so they say
Come on, come on, there has to be a better way.
Get up, get up, let's leave this mess.
I know a place that we can get away from all of this.
Come on come on, get up, get up
I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known.
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go.

No, we can't leave 'til you tell me everything.
So come clean, don't talk in tongues.
It's time to bring out your dead.
And all the skeletons that you've been hiding.
Tell me everything I need to know.
Bring out your dead, bring out your dead 

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us.
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long.
All is fair in war or so they tell me
All is fair in war or so they say
Come on come on, get up, get up
I know a place that we can get away from all of this, yeah 

I couldn't see a thing 'til I shut my eyes.
I never knew a thing 'til I lost my mind.
I would sell my soul to know it all, But I held the keys all this time

I couldn't see a thing 'til I shut my eyes.
I never knew a thing 'til I lost my mind.
I would sell my soul to know it all, But I held the keys all this time

I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go
I've been dreaming of us leaving everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead


You're hypnotized, can't see the signs
I'd like to help you, but I think it's too late
Made up your mind and now you're blind
I guess it's easier than making mistakes

Don't ask me why then roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight, but I won't bite at the page
And I'ma try and change your eyes to the pain
'Cause I will tell you

So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe

Give me a break 'cause I can't take
Another second, you're a fucking addict
I need the time to change your mind
How can I move you when you're stuck in your ways

Don't ask me why then roll your eyes at the answer
You want to fight, but I don't bite on the bait
And I'm not tryin' to change your eyes from the pain
I'm just saying, no I'm just saying

Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
'Cause you dug yourself into this hole all by yourself
Don't come crawling back to me when you break down
You can find somebody else

So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe

You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it when you believe
You'll see it, you'll see it
And you'll see it when you believe

Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to kill myself just for the fucking fun
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to slit my wrists and play in my own blood
Yeah, hell yeah
You make me want to kill myself just for the fucking fun

So don't tell me what I can't see
'Cause we both know it's you, not me
You don't want this but it's what you need
And you'll see it when you believe
And you'll see it when you believe


A cherry sunset blossoms,
But we're not there to watch it fall,
On the vacant canvas, we should be waiting,
With our face down on the grass,
Staring till our eyes give way,
Let's paint this city black,
While the night's still young,

You,

This cherry sunset withers,
Our words as frail as paper,
A dawn I thought we'd never see,
Alone on this silent beach,
Nothing we can do,
There is nothing we can do,

The sky, it burns itself,
The sky, it burns itself,
The sky, it burns itself out,
The sky, it burns itself,

The trees rot down to nothing,
Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks,
These promenades our graveyards,

The sky, it burns itself out,
The sky, it burns itself out,

There is nothing we can do,
The sky, it burns itself,
And I think we're all about to fucking die,

The trees rot down to nothing,
Throats dry out, corpses fill these sidewalks,
These promenades our graveyards,
Kneeling down on what's left,
Sacrificed upon doom's day,
Oh, if we could take it back, and see one last twilight,

Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture,

Take a picture, take a picture,
Take a picture, take a picture,
It will last longer,

Our hands in prayer formation,
Our elbows on the bed,
One last try for Heaven,
Thinking who wants flowers when you're dead?
You're dead,
When you're dead,

Cherry, cherry,
Cherry, cherry,

Cherry, cherry,
Cherry, cherry,

Cherry,
A cherry sunset


Everyone it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see my dear is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear it's all down hill from here

My love in your hand cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone, crumble in the light

Most of what you see my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of want to show
Because not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
Not everything that goes around, comes back around you know
One thing that is clear
It's all down hill from here


There is no yesterday
There is no tomorrow
Can't look, can't speak
Another word
As far as you know
Over and over
Clear and forgotten

Over and over
Over and over
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow


It's late enough to go drivin
And see what's mine
That's a study of dying
How to do it right
You're a holy roller
Get your bed in the loose
If you're hanging around
I'm holdin' the noose

Come a little bit closer
And get on tight
In a horse rollin' over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

Come on, let's go drivin'
Come on, let's take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right


Nobody's coming down the hall
Nobody echoes in my head
Broken reflection had a look
Nobody ever needed her

I got what was
I want to take what's left
Ready now

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin'

Sweet, soft, and low
I will poison you all
Come closer, racing to your turn

I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
For the deaf

I can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
So low round my neck
Strung out every stitch

Who are you hiding
Is it safe for the deaf
Beautiful cancer
Infiltrate and forget
And I saw you coming
And I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you'd been

And I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
For the deaf


I saw you in a way
But that's another life
Maybe they're the same
I wonder where you are
Yesterday is gone
But it ain't far away
I guess it's far enough

I'm older in my head
My innocence is gone
I have the book you read
To help me carry on
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
I was blind when he said

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
He said, but he was wrong

I'm your Jezebel (she said)
On my way to hell (she said)
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
She was blind when she said

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are
She said, but she was wrong

Ooh ooh it's all the same
No matter where you are


You're so impossible
Scream and moan it chills my soul
Don't want to hear you got left behind
All those times you stayed up and cried
It's no lie
You did it to yourself
Like chewed up gum under my shelf
Don't look surprised
You must have know all along

It's just another love song
Another love song

It's never easy
It's not hard
When you've lost your mind
With you it's sleezy
Don't tell me your worries
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind
Now the time has come
To leave this love that's left you dry
No need to work this out now
Cause you know there's no reason why

It's just another love song
Another love song

I never told you it would last forever
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it
By the time you read my letter
Baby, I'll be gone

You're just another love song
Another love song


Silent hell on the marble slab
The best trip that I've ever had
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around
My drinks on empty, need another round

[Chorus]
I want to fly, want to ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I want to fly, want to ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times
I never seen you before
But now that I have, I don't want to see you no more

Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

[Chorus]

Ah-ah, auto pilot no control
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control
Ah-ah, ah

Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

[Chorus]


I see you go
Through a park in a haze
And I don't listen
For traffic going the same way
A simple system, yeah
I string 'em up
I cut 'em down
Dare I say

To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to

A perfect vision
Some simple ways to let you know
Free range humans all cooped up
Naked clone is playing lame, yeah
I string 'em up
I cut 'em down
Dare I say

To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to
To to to to to


I didn't mean to turn you on, no way
just wanna dance and sing my song, oh okay
Clocking in, clocking out,
no I don't mind it at all
Me and the danger dudes
were on the news, so just don't bother to call, because...

It's just a way to stay alive, boy
it's such a trip just to survive

So it's back, back to dungaree high
just to get high, back to dungaree high
just a great big boy -
with a teeny-weeny alibi

Just a soul on ice
With a mirror and a blade
and a pocket full of mice
Cheap thrills done and the dirt cheap ants
'cause I got a headache in my pants

I got a headache in my pants
I got a headache in my pants
I got a headache in my pants, because...

It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive
So it's back, back to dungaree high
just to get high, back to dungaree high
just a great big boy -
with a teeny-weeny alibi

It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive, boy
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive, boy
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive
back to dungaree
back to dungaree
back to dungaree high



Make you into dark
Straight into your heart
Sorry all you are
I don't really care
Well, I know you are...

Robots, robots
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech
Spoken rabies
Spastic, plastic, battery acid
Yank on the leash
Draggin' you backwards
Oh, my closed eyes 
Never see it comin'

There's nothing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
The sadistic twist you'll never learn
Battery acid, battery acid

Battery acid in my veins
Unidentified remains
"Yes" button broke to automatic
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are
You were

(Jealous)
To feel the way you do
(To mention)
A lie, then call it true
(Feel for)
Nothing except for yourself and nobody else
Hanging over the edge

There's nothing you can say
You can't wish me away
Every masochist gets a turn
The sadistic twist you'll never learn
In battery acid, battery acid, hey


The blue pill opens your eyes
Is there a better way
A new religion prescribed
To those without the faith
The hero holding a knife
And blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back?
Is it too late to go?

There's no one here
And people everywhere, you're on your own 

Let's see if I'm hearing this right
Is it just I should take
And never endings are glad
To carry out the dead
Your idols burn in the fire
The mob comes crawling out (take us down and out)
I'm reclaiming their minds
Destroying everyone

There's no one here
And people everywhere, you're all alone


Demon is up in the attic to the left
My eyes turns to the left to say no
You say first I am a special one
I never hammered my mind out
I never had the bloody hammer
I never had the bloody
Never had the bloody
Never had the bloody hammer

I am the Doctor
I am the Psychiatrist
To make sure they don't think that
They'd hammer their minds out
Or that they'd have a
That they'd have a bloody hammer

Second, I am this special one
My eyes are green and blue
Move safely un-begot
To the left to say no
While the others 
With their hair turned white
Each roll their eyes back
To the top of their heads
And hammer the attic, 
With a bloody hammer
I never had the bloody hammer
I never had the bloody
Never had the bloody
Never had the bloody hammer

The demon is up in the attic to the left
My eyes turn to the left to say no
You say first, I am a special one
I never hammered my mind out
I never had the bloody hammer

It's not a sledgehammer
It's not a chisel
It's not a train
But a thought of unlimited horror 
For Dr. O'Chain

Dr. O'Chain

The baby ghost says
Beat it with your chain
The baby ghost says
Drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chain

All these bats are Dracula vampires
Vampires in rain
Vampires in the lightning 
For Dr. O'Chain

Dr. O'Chain

The baby ghost says
Beat it with your chain
The baby ghost says
Drag your spoon, drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chain

The demon is up in the attic to the left
Eyes turns to the left to say no
You say first, I am a special one
I never hammered my mind out
I never had the bloody hammer
I never had the bloody
Never had the bloody
Never had the bloody hammer


Follow trails of you to here
Every mile takes you my way
Rolling faster than we can

Tables turnin' all the time
I'm the dog at your feet
So we are it again

You're the one

Fucking have to wait a dime
Every single flingin' mile
They're coming faster all the while

You're the one

Ain't it somethin', we're born to hula


I've got wine 
&
so do you
Mine came with a cork
I wish yours did too

Everyone just loves you so
Well hurray!
Now you know where to go

In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where i came
In my head you're all brand new
I just didn't want what you gave
In my head you're all brand new
Go 
&
find yourself another slave

There you are
Ooohh you're so in love, just like juliette
Well guess what?
That's one thing that you can for-fucking-get

Tears from the sky
In pools of pain
Well baby tonite, i'm gonna go 
&
dance in the rain

In my head you're all brand new
I guess you're really all the same
In my head you're all brand new
Tell your new boy where i came
In my head you're all brand new
Take that broken pussy elsewhere
In my head you're all brand new
Save it baby, i don't care


Holding hands
Skipping like a stone
On our way
To see what we have done
The first to speak
Is the first to lie
The children cross
Their hearts 
hope to die

Bite your tongue
Swear to keep your mouth shut

Ask yourself
Will i burn in Hell?
Then write it down

cast it in the well
There they are
The mob it cries for blood
To twist the tale
Into fore wood
Fan the flames
With a little lie
Then turn your cheek
Until the fire dies
The skin it peels
Like the truth, away
What it was
I will never say...

Bite your tongue, swear to keep
Keep your mouth shut
Make up something
Make up something good...
Holding hands
Skipping like a stone
Burn the witch
Burn to ash 
bone


No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around
Christian Brothers going to take him down
But it can't help me get over

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I'll to shake your motherfucking hand
But I know how much you care

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear


I fall over and over and over over over on you
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill, you're the only one I'm into
You and me
Fit so tight
I go lower and lower and lower lower livin easy
I don't know, I don't know what I got till it's over
You and me
Fit so tight

Can you do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again

All the way, all the way, all the way, there's no where left we can meet
I'm into what you do but I leave you no where
You and me
Fit so tight
All we need
Is one more time

Can you do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Can you do it again

I only get to live one life
I won't pretend you're only mine
Where will you go, where will you find the way

To do it again
Do it again


Today is the day, bewilderness
Comes to reclaim everything
Burning bridge lights up the sky
Zip your lip until you've picked a side

You get right up then sit back down
The revolution is one spin 'round
You get back up then sit right down
A revolution is one spin 'round

All for one, all for naught
Perish, baby, perish the thought
Beat the kids to the punch
You've got heart, I'll have it for lunch

You get right up then sit back down
The revolution is one spin 'round
You get back up then sit right down
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down

Tell me, where's the goddamn gold?
Gold

Pretty pets, once were wild
Domesticated love slave, give us a smile
You got a number, is it the same?
Who you belong to?
You feral or tame? (Probably tame)

Tell us where you keep the gold (For what?)
We wanna help you rule the world (I think not)
We won't tell a single soul (So they all say)
So tell us, where's the goddamn gold?

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the reason?
It's in the lost and found

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the freedom?
In the lost and found
Still not found

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's all mine
Mine

Get right up, kneel and bow
Where's your revolution now?
Get back up, sit right down
Tears of gold, drink them down

Get right up, kneel and bow
Shrunken heads parade through town
Tears of gold, drink them down
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down


I play a game 'til I'm dead
Or on a magazine
I wanna look like I'm dead
Dancing on a string
I eat the food when it's there
Make a mess of things
Get that look everywhere
But keep that look off my face

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

From a crumbling tower I see everything
London, Tokyo, New York City
There's no love any place

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

All we creatures helplessly attacking repetition
Over, over left with who we are
Did you tell anyone?
Did you tell any place?

Everybody else wanna fall in love
There's no room for love in a modern sky
Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

Living in the era vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights

Just stare at the lights


You want to know why you feel so hollow?
Because you are.
You're missing out? Well if you say so
Then you're missing out

Everybody knows that you are insane
You want to know just how long you can hide from what you are?
Not very long
I have been lost. Down every road I follow out in the dark
On my way home

But I feel nothing. Am I better yet?

Everybody knows that you are insane


And I know, I know
I know that everybody
I know that everybody be happy
Happy as you and me
Cause I know
I know

Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love

And I know, I know
And when I see you walkin down the street
Well it makes me happy to see you walkin
Makes my life complete
Cause I know
I know

Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love

And I know, I know
I know that you and me
I know that you and me be happy
A'happy as we can be
Cause I know
I know 

Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell ya
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love

I know, I know


Is there anyone out there?
Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone before
The first rain could fall

It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone so are
Well, so are you

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossip, drugs, and snakes
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)
Fair weather friends (fair weather friends)

One day when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink and screw is all we'll do
Every day

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossip, drugs, and snakes
They're just our best fair weather friends (fair weather friends)

And though the hour's late
Don't let 'em in your head (fair weather friends)
Gonna pray for rain again and again
Fair weather friends
Fair weather friends

Fair I don't give a shit about 'em anyhow


Nicotine, valium, vicadin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol
Cocaine


I was born in the desert, May
Seventeen in seventy-three
When the needle hit the groove
I commenced moving
I was chasing what's calling me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter
One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Life is hard, that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
Foot loose and fancy free

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter
And my head's in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Push myself to breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase the gates and drift ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, 
One must tell civil lies

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, oh oh ah
That's the sound that's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's

Time to go
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We took the long way home

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do whatcha gotta do
And do it now
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on


I'm in you
You're in me
I can't tell

You're so cruel
More than me
It is true
That's right

Loyal to
Only you
Up your sleeve

I want some (come on, take it)
Of all of you (it's yours)
Trickin' me

First it give'th
Then it take'th away

I would beg
I would plead
I would shake

On a hook
Dangling
By the way

I'm so young
And beautiful
(That's right)
(I'm slick)
I'm no fool

Time goes by
Tables turn
Now I know

First it give'th
Then it take'th away


Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?

You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you're afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone
As I have felt

I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behind everything happens
Every night that falls breaks
To sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
Come on through
Come on through


The mule want it
The mule want it Sunday
He'll eat it
He'll eat it one day
How long, long
Do I wait
Be the mule that you gotta be, yeah

Underwater, underwater one day
Gonna sink it, make em think it's too late
For your love
For your love
Be the mule that you gotta be
Oh oh 
Oh oh
Oh oh


She said "I'll throw myself away,
They're just photos after all"
I can't make you hang around.
I can't wash you off my skin.
Outside the frame, is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway
I can go with the flow
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore
I can go with the flow
Do you believe it in your head?
It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
With something sweet to throw away.
But I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live.
I want a new mistake, lose is more than hesitate.
Do you believe it in your head?
I can go with the flow
But don't say it doesn't matter anymore
I can go with the flow
Do you believe it in your head?


I thought I saw him on the video
A trance is keeping him under
I know that god is in the radio
Checkin' the station
I'm glad I caught it from me to you
Just a call in the medium
I know you hear it, I hear it too
It's everywhere that I go

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong

The say the devil is paranoid
Always signin' the cover
But god is leakin' through the stereo
Between the station to station
You believe it, I know you do
You won't admit it or say so
I know that god is in the radio
Just repeating a slogan

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong


I'm goin' out west 
Where the wind blows tall
Where Tony Franciosa
Used to date my 'ma
They got some money out there
They're giving it away
I'm gonna do what I want
And I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want
And I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby, I'm a leading man
Well my parole officer will be proud of me
With my Olds '88 and the devil on a leash
My Olds '88 and the devil on a leash

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

Well I don't lose my composure
In a high speed chase
My friends say I'm ugly
I got a masculine face
I got some drag strip courage
I can really drive a bed
I'm gonna change my name
To Hannibal or maybe just Rex
Change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex

I know karate, Voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no make up
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt

I'm gonna drive all night
Get some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun
To shine down on me
I got a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart

And I'm goin' out west
Where they appreciate me
Goin' out west
Where they appreciate me

Goin' out west
Gone


Wait by the phone
Late alone
He can't help you
But I know I could

Free is too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you

I gave it starts
I stomped on your hearts
This the is the end,
No more pictures, we ain't friends
It's raining in my room
There's blood in my spoon
You're out of my highchair
I'm out of your womb

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you

Free is too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
Gonna leave you

I'm gonna leave
I don't need you


When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you will do then?
But that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road


Would you like our way home
I bleed my own

Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swayin'

Can you see under my thumb
There you are

Round the hangin' tree
Swing in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swing


Your head's like a haunted house
A trutti frutti written over the caption
A misdiagnosis with-a the most-est
Cue the evil smile
Desperation can led to madness
De-de-degradation is a must
The A-B-Cs of leprosy

Need a hand take mine
We're supreme, sublime
Fake apologize
Fucks in short supply

Too late, too sick, too young
Catgut-like reflex of the tongue
Say 'ahh', say what
Say 'man, don't even think about it'
Push the pesticide
Xana-dos and xana-don'ts
Let you mock and then copulate me
a dirty trick and it's making me sick (Urgh!)

(You okay?) I'm fine
Laughter is my friend
We're supreme, sublime
G-g-g-goddamn cry

Tonight
I'm gonna put up a fight
I'm gonna get a reaction that I'm right
From the day
Slap my dick in his face
I demand satisfaction
For the night
To trick them all because of which is why I'm ashamed
Petty disguises more like skins, a distinction, vice
Drink the kool-aid
And swallow the pills
Say that you don't
And you won't but you will
Busted

Your head's like a haunted house
Peepin' at your mumbo jumbo
I'm a psycho, go bump in the night
Suicide
Make my cereal so superior
And in a race for second place
Circumstances in my pants
Is calling for action
Girl, I'll blow your mind
When you with your man
We're supreme, sublime
You know I polarize


The kid who wants some of the pretties in life
Tried shortcuts those and missed his fight
The first hands, the back hands, the bruises, the bites
The painful spoonful of hustle and fights
Speak my name and I'll appear
Right here

Hideaway
Hideaway

I'm all dressed up, no one left to blow
The diction, the friction, these you wrote
Left with the taste of flesh and bone
It's a beautiful day in the USA
My eye requires a pupil and I'm sure
It's yours

Hideaway
Hideaway

You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, entangled forever in my arms
You'll feel love

Feel the senses, what you lose
Like keys and dreams and old tattoos
With one quick twist, love turns to scar
To cruising, the bruises in my car
Catch the keys and take the wheel and drive
For a while

Hideaway
Hideaway

You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, entangled forever in my arms
You owe me everything
You owe me everything

Don't you feel love
Don't you feel love
Oh my God
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Who needs love?


[Instrumental]


Too late to think 
&
filter anymore
A bitter pill to swallow cause maybe you're..
..In a blanket haze of ephedrine
I'm wonderin' where the hell you been
So come on and right this wrong, you know

You got it all right
You got a feeling
I'd rather open up my wrist, let it go
You got it all right
You got a feeling
There's devils and ropes around your neck
You can't even know
You can't hear it?
Can't hear it

Ain't got a mind to deal with anymore
Saboteur! infiltrator! maybe more.
If you're not blind and deaf, how can we pollute your head?
So come on and right this wrong, you know

And I got it all right
I got a feeling
You'd rather open up your wrist, and let it go
I got it all right, yeah
I got a feeling
There's devils and ropes around my neck I can't even know
'Cause they can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it
Can't hear it


Calling all comas,
Prisoner on the loose
Description:
A spitting image of me
Except for a heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prison of sleep
Deepened now
A rabbit hole never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone
Feelings, raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
But dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found

It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground

Dancing on wire both ends are on fire
Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met

Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found

Don't cry
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view
Inside
I never loved anything until I loved you
Inside
I'm over the edge, what can I do?
Inside
I never loved anything until I loved you

Don't cry
With my toes on the edge it's such a lovely view
Inside
I never loved anything until I loved you
Inside
I'm over the edge, what can I do?
Inside

I've fallen through


When you say it's dead 
&
gone
I know you're wrong

Cut 
&
slash, sharpest knife
It won't die

Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die

No fire, no gun, no rope, no stoner
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place
Cause I DON'T CARE
If you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night,
In your bed...

Laws of man, are just pretend
They ain't mine

Love so good, love so bad
It won't die

Some talk too long, they know it all
I just smile 
&
move on

Words ain't free, like you 
&
me
I d'ont mind...

Why'd you have to be so mean 
&
cruel,
The dogs are loose i'm on to you
You ball 
&
...
Chained together from the dawn to dusk,
Can't call it leavin, cause it's just

I never came....


I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby to erase you
Face down in the boulevard yet I couldn't face you

There ain't no use in cryin'
It doesn't change anything, so baby what good does it do?
Your friends they'll sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, 'Boy if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new'
'Do you know who you really are? Are you sure it's really you'?
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagine I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer
We're passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer
We're crashing ships in the night


You know why
They called and just let it ring
No reply
The door is open I swear
Ain't no use in pickin' up
You know why

[Chorus]
It's all my head I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Into my head it goes

Tastes so good
Oh, but I knew it would
Tastes so good
Burn like a match house
Medicate just to make you soft
Love is blind

Catchin' the rest me
What the hell were they thinking of
You know why

[Chorus]


Cozied up to the toilet
Face stuck to the floor
I met expectations 
That I was tryin' to ignore 

Job had such patience
I wonder, what's that like?
One hundred thousand million
That's what you like
So I was thinkin'

So these cities are sprouting
Like a spit in the eye
And this world isn't waiting
It's just passing me by

I just peak in the window
Lookin' inside
The butcher's got a fork in your face
I'm standing alive
And I was singin'


My generation's for sale
Beats a steady job
How much have you got?

My generation don't trust no one
It's hard to blame
Not even ourselves

The thing that's real for us is: fortune and fame
All the rest seems like work
It's just like diamonds
In shit

I'm high class, I'm a whore
Actually both
Basically, I'm a pro
We've all got our own style of baggage
Why hump it yourself?

You've made me an offer that I can refuse
'Cause either way I get screwed
Counter proposal: I go home and jerk off, uh

It's truly a lie
I counterfeit myself
It's truly a lie
I counterfeit myself
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own, you don't own
You don't own what none can buy
You don't own
(You don't own)
Neither do I

High and mighty, you say selling out is a shame
Is that the name of your book?
Push a silver spoon in your ass
No more holding us
Down, dog, down, mutt, nice mutt

You're insulted you can't be bought or sold
Translation: offer too low
You don't know what you're worth
It isn't much
My piano's for sale
How many times must I sell myself
Before my pieces are gone?
I'm one of a kind! I'm designer!

Never again will I repeat myself
Enough is never enough
Never again will I repeat myself

It used to be the plan was screwing the man
Now it's have sex with a man
(After he buys your dot-com for sale at a low, low price)

It's truly a lie
I counterfeit myself
It's truly a lie
I counterfeit myself
You don't own, you don't own, you don't own me
You don't own what none can buy
You don't own...
You don't own what none can buy
Neither do I


Gitchy, gitchy
Ooh la la
Da doo ron ron
You won't get far

I'm machine
I'm obsolete
In the land of the free
Lobotomy

I wanna suck, I wanna lick
I want to cry and I want to spit
Tears of pleasure
Tears of pain
They trickle down your face the same

It's how you look
Not how you feel
A city of glass
With no heart

If I had a tail
I'd own the night
If I had a tail
I'd swat the flies

Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Yeah, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Gitchy, gitchy
Ooh la la
Da doo ron ron
It won't get far

Animals in
The midnight zone
When you own the world
You're always home

Get your hands dirty
Roll up them sleeves
Brainwashed or true believers?
Buy flash cars
Diamond rings
Expensive holes to bury things

I'm machine
I'm obsolete
In the land of the free
Immortality

If I had a tail
I'd own the place
If I had a tail
I'd swat the flies

Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

See me dancing on the stars
See me dance

If I have a tail
I will control the night
If I have a tail
I will control the night
If I have a tail
I will control the night


If it gets you down well then I'll take it
If it gets you up well I don't want it
It let you down so broken-hearted
If it gets you down well then I want it

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all

So blow our mind and make it lazy
Those long, long days with no escaping
I hold the wheel to let it go
Don't want to stop, don't want to know
If it gets you down, well just don't blame me

If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
If only, only
We're nothing at all


If it gets you down
Well then I want it
If it gets you up, well
I don't want it
Lets you down
So broken hearted
If it gets you down
Well then I want it

If only we're nothing at all

So blow my mind
It's just so crazy
Those long, long days
Just make it eighty
So roll the wheel
And there it goes
And where it stops
You never know
If it gets you down
Then just don't blame me

If only we're nothing at all

Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow
They don't know I never do you any good
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live till you die, want to drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone
There's nothing to save I know
You live till you die

Live till you die, I know

Loosing feelin', but I couldn't get the way ?
Countin' and breathin', disappearin' in the fade
They don't know I never do you any good
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live till you die, want to drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone
There's nothing to save I know
You live till you die


Got a hole in my head
Everything falls right out
Through my ears, through my eyes
Makes no difference where you are

You wanna know how I do it?
I do it all right
You wanna know how I do it
I do it all right

I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing can fill it up
I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing

A new road, a new road
A new road, a new road
You never get right back
A new road
You never get it right back
A new road

You wanna know how I do it?
You wanna know how I do it
You wanna know how I do it
I do it all right

I gotta hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing that can fill it up
I gotta hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing out there

Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
So I sing






Avoir, adieu, goodnight
I'm too wrong to get right
But I can't wait forever
I've always been alone
A fool believes he's clever

Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone
Aren't you gonna follow?

I live behind my eyes
Be sure to keep the surprise
I break what I've, I've borrowed
That's why I always go
Alone into tomorrow

Don't you wanna go into the hollow?
I won't go alone
Aren't you gonna follow?

Into the hollow
Into the hollow


You're jealous again
No, she's just a friend
Why can't I do nothing without getting yelled at?
Always on the phone
Never leave me alone
Why don't you tell me what you want from me?

Said I'll never leave you, no, I'll never leave you
It's not the end, no, it's not the end

I won't beat you up
And I won't push you around
Because if I do the cops are going to get me for it
I want to go and have some fun
Go where the action is
And who the hell are you to tell me who my friends are?

Said I'll never leave you, no, I'll never leave you
It's not the end, no, it's not the end

Said I'll never leave you, no, I'll never leave you
It's not the end, no, it's not the end

You're jealous again
You're jealous again
You're jealous again
And again and again
And again and again
And again and again


I never lie
To myself
Tonight.

Rose, tinted eyes
Color my sorrow
A shade of 'why?

Bye bye black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye bye
Bye bye

Why were you so sad
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing God

Copy cats in cheap suits
All playing it safe
While cannibals with their noose
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?

Kalopsia, kalopsia, kalopsia
Kalopsia, kalopsia

Far, far from shore
The land of nightmares
Gone forever more

And I love you more
Than I can control
I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all

Fates favor the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they run, as they run
To hell


Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, trapped in my minefield
Shotgun, never behind the wheel anymore
Danger, monsters of smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

And I know, you will never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream, then
Wake me up

Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from Hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
Daydream until all the blue is gone

And I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream,
Wake me

Underwater is another life
Disregarding every myth we write
Rag doll churning
Eagerly alive

Big smile, really a show of teeth
Without a care in a world of fear
Lonely, you don't know how I feel
Praise God, nothing is as it seems


You're a head case with a smile
Can't stop to make up your mind
Education is so lame (so lame)
When you bitch and you moan
You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (hey)
You're a truth freak with a lie
The situation is so strange
It's a TV show
Click

In a hotel on the phone
You're gonna leave me, I should've known (should've known)
And I was thinkin', it's so sad
I didn't want you to go
Don't want to follow the laws of man (yes sir)
Bloody apron, leg of lamb
It's so hard to win
When there's so much to lose

Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
This ain't reality
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
Because it is natural

Second Avenue, raising Cain
I'm a sinner, ring my bell (ring my bell)
I'll tell you what, I get up
If I knew I fell


[Instrumental]


Since you're gone, I sat at home 
Wonder why not I'll never be free 
But the thought of you 
Goin' with another guy 
No, it could never be me 
You took a ring and pawned our love away 
What can I say, I am left behind 
So I take a drink, another cigarette 
I can't forget that you once were mine 

What can I say? 
I guess it wasn't meant to be 
Now you're gone, 
It's just, your love is like a drug 

It's been so long 
Your folks have bet you gone 
I know that you're alive inside 
So I hope and pray you won't throw this love away 
I just wish that you still were mine


Hey, sister, are you all alone? 
I'm standing out your window 
Hey, little sister, can I come inside you?
I want to show you all my love 
I want to be the only one 
I know you like nobody ever, baby 

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow 

You whisper secrets in my ear 
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek 
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby 
They say I'll only do you wrong 
Come together 'cause I understand 
Just who you really are, yeah, baby 

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind a shadow

I shake up.


Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where have you gone again my sweet?
Everybody wants to know
Where you gone?

I'm just a ghost, I'm on your street
Waitin', when you comin' home?
Gone so long
Where you gone?
On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye...

In every voice, I hear you speak
Waitin' by the telephone
I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Roll 
tumble all night long
All night long
Where you gone?

I close my eyes, I just can't sleep
Where have you gone again my sweet?

On a long slow goodbye?
On a long slow goodbye...

Goodbye


Where O where have you been my love?
Where O where can you be?
It's been so long, since the moon has gone.
0 what a wreck you've made me.

Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?
Until the return of my love
This lullaby

My Hope is on the horizon
Every face, it's your eyes i can see
I plead, i pray through each night 
day
Our Embrace is only a dream.

As sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby


You wanna know if I know why
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the you or I
Or how one becomes two
I just can't recall what started it off
Or how to begin again
I ain't here to break ya
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit' chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu

Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That just ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I won't do
Anytime, anywhere, and I said

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit' chu
Yeah
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit' chu

I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit' chu
I wanna make it
(Again and again)
I wanna make it wit' chu
(Again and again, and again, and again)
I wanna make it


Medication for us all, it is a new way

&
we're gonna take it cause wa love it
Don't you know?

Is this the dose you've been dreamin' of?
A revelation from a gun
Doesn't matter
Overtaken, mine was yours, now overthrown

Just copulation in a song
I'mso contagious, can i cum?
In the new way
All of us cast asides became what has become

Medication for us all
You think you know me, well you're wrong
Doesn't matter
All of us cast asides became what has become


Setting sun deals hands of gold
There's velvet eyes in Mexico
Just a fall away
And all she said was true

Speak in tongues, speak in lies
Drooling livers, born to die
It's a wonder that those guns don't point at you

Oh oh oh oh

Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', 
You won't live forever

Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', 
You won't live forever

Point and shoot, I know just what you mean
In a world that's full of shit and gasoline, baby
One dog's dead one's on the phone
Just leave a lung or leave it alone
It's that same on song again
I hate it 'cause it's true

Oh oh oo oo

Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', 
You won't live forever

Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', go on, 
Keep sayin', 
You won't live forever


Wanna see my passin' flames?
Don't waste a drop, baby, I ain't first
Where I was born, no escape
There ain't even no good bad drugs
In the city, is it true?
If you don't, you act like you do
Feast of fools, I can't wait
Give 'em a taste of my misfit love

Complicate
Incarcerate
Feel my heart wake up?

Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so goddamn sick, baby, it's a sin
It's a sin

Transforming is becoming... 
Transforming is becoming on me

Do me first, do your worst
Gimme what I want some of
One-track mind, no time to waste

Sidewalks, feel me strut so good
Gutter, don't forget this face
Let 'em taste my misfit love
I'll show you all my dirty tricks
Then show 'em again I'm so proud of 'em
It's cruel to be constantly
Feel my heart play dumb

Ain't born to lose, baby
I'm born to win
I'm so sick, baby, it's a sin
It's a sin

Just a dead man, walking through the dead of night
And if you're going anywhere tonight...
Just a dead end walking through the dead of night
And if you are going, can I get a ride?
Just a dead man walking through the dead of night
It's impossible to wait until the light
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won
'Cause I'm already gone
If you bet on me, you've won


The walls are closing in again, oh well
The walls are closing in again, oh well
I seen some thing I thought I never saw
Covered in hair
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
And my mind is out here on another wave
Covered in hair

She won't grow

[Chorus]
You've got a monster (distress) in your parasol (body out??)
You've got a monster (dwarfs, doors?) in your parasol (of course)
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol (I told you??)
You've got a monster ? in your parasol (x-nay?)
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well

Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
I seen some things I thought I never saw
Covered in hair

She won't grow

You've got a monster (distress, my pest?) in your parasol
You've got a monster (dwarfs) in your parasol (war horse)
You've got a monster (displeasure) in your parasol ?
You've got a hole in you I never saw ?
In your parasol, in your parasol


the astral map that's overhead
watch it while it is unfolding

the fabric of the universe
out of which this earth is woven
the moon is a mirror alike
she returns my loving

wheels are turning before my eyes
reels of film are running by
I can see miles passing

the astral map that's overhead
watch it while it is unfolding

maybe it won't be that far
it won't be long before we're getting
to enjoy this setting

we're getting closer to where we're heading
we've been chosen
to enjoy this setting

that astral map that's overhead
watch it while it is unfolding

wheels are turning before my eyes
reels of film are running by
I can see miles passing

into fata morgana's I melt
onto the buckle of orion's belt


I know, I know the sun is hot
Mosquito's come suck your blood
Leave you there all alone
Just skin and bone

When you walk among the trees
Listening to the leaves
The further I go the less I know
The less I know

Where will you run?
Where will you hide?
Lullabies
To paralyze

Fat and soft, pink and weak
Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek
You know I'm told they swallow you whole
Skin and bone

Cutting boards and hanging hooks
Bloody knives, cooking books
Promising you won't feel a thing
At all

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died
And the light says

Somehow they pick and pluck
Tenderize bone to dust
The sweetest grease, finest meat you'll ever taste
Taste, taste
So you scream, whine, and yell
Supple sounds of dinner bells
We all will feed the worms and trees So don't be shy

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died


Far beyond the desert road
Where everything ends up
So good the empty space, mental erase
Forgive, forgot

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the Sun
Heal them, with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the Sun

I don't know what time it was
I don't wear a watch
So good to be an ant who crawls
Atop a spinning rock

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the Sun
Heal them, with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the Sun

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the Sun
Healing, kneeling
Godless heathens

Godless heathens always waltz on the sky


Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long life
And you go oh oh, oh oh

Goes to show
How winds blow
The weather's fine
And I feel so so-so, so

Birds of prey
With too much to say
Oh, what could be my destiny?
Another rainy day

Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more
Needles in the camel's eye

Those who know
They don't let it show
They just give you one long life
And you go oh oh, oh oh

Why ask why?
For by the by and by
All mysteries are just more
Needles in the camel's eye


If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer
Of sunlight landi' on the street
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

The slump by the courthouse
With windburn skin
That man could give a fuck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleepin' on papers
When he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's somethin'
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

There's no easy way to lose your sight
On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin
But he's got her and she's got him

Never say never


We get some rules to follow
That and this
These and those
No one knows

We get these pills to swallow
How they stick
In your throat
Tastes like gold

Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
Ah

I journey through the desert
Of the mind
With no hope
I found low

I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboats in the sun
And come undone

Pleasantly caving in
I come undone

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool I
Ah

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift her below
But no one knows

A gift that you give to me
No one knows


We get some rules to follow
That and this
These and those
No one knows

We get these pills to swallow
How they stick
In your throat
Tastes like gold

Oh, what you do to me

Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine

I knock on your door
I tiptoe on the floor
I hope your daddy ain't home right now
He warned me once before

You know he warned me once before

I stay up late
So we can keep our date
I love that we don't get no sleep
So to your window I creep
You know he warned me once before

[Chorus]
I'm the one your mamma told ya 'bout
I'm the one your papa told ya 'bout

Now you're in love
And why shouldn't you be
I'm everything you'll never be
You say don't leave
Baby, I can't wait
Next time, we share my second base

[Chorus]


Riding down the floodway on a Friday night,
the landscape's a fine and natural sight.
Just cruising slow through the dark of night.
With Precious and Grace everything's all right.

Good God Almighty, we was going down slow,
yeah, if we knew just where we had to go.
Crying, just a flying down a put out road
with Precious and Grace in my flathead Ford.

So if you're out riding late one night,
yeah, and you need that supernatural delight, I'm talkin to you, brother!
I know somebody's, they's just out of sight.
Get with Precious and Grace, they gonna treat you right. 


I don't even know what I'm doin' here
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Oh

A little girl, can never see
Awkward, stumbling, gotta be with me
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go!
Oh baby baby yes I swear
Who

Blamin' this heart
With a lesson to be borne
I'm so old, you're so young!

I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go!
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear
Goddamn it
Whoa
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Little girl
Listen to what I say

You know, I know
Everybody, everyone, let's go!
Oh baby, baby, yes I swear
Who
Ah ah oh baby baby yes I swear
Goddamn it 
Whoa


Who are you girl?
Who are you boy?
Bet I know what you're up to
Can I come along
Your home number's on the wall
I just had to call, had to
I'm not the only one
Who will run with a knife

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms

One six two seven eight
Two six three seven eight nine
Where's your daddy now
I heard he ran away
Who are you girl?

'Cause I'm so bored with myself
Anyway
Any time and any place
I'll just hang around

[Chorus]

One six two seven eight
Two six three seven eight nine

[Chorus]

Open up your eyes
Open up your room
Open up your arms
Open up your door
Open up your eyes
Open up your room


Fast approaching monsters marching in a row
Grab what slips your mind and what your memory won't hold
Run, darling, run
I'll stall them if I can
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine

Run, darling, run
I'll stall if I can
You'll escape, and I'll be left rotting on the vine
Avert the children's eyes
Forgets left untold
Don't look back to see
The blood river in the road

Get sweet revenge with my blood river in the road


When I was young, we used to play the game called hide and seek
Someone'd go hide, I'd count to ten
You probably never played, instead you talked a game of sheep
A skill you almost do perfect

Run, pig, run
Here I come

Woo, hoo, hoo, run
Woo, hoo, hoo, run
Woo, hoo, hoo, run

I am no saint and make no claims to being in the right
It's just for now, I am wrong less
You're probably wondering with what to do this has with you
I wanna play the game you missed

Run, pig, run
Here I come

There is no safe place
There is no safe place
There is no safe place to hide

Woo, hoo, hoo, run
Woo, hoo, hoo, run
Woo, hoo, hoo, run


When I was a little boy
I looked under the stairs
The king and the pawns 
Were caught unawares
Standing in the shadows
A whisperer to be 
Just fishing in the darkness
Oh, possibilities
Just look at you now, yeah...
Look at you now
Yeah, oh
Look at you now.

Among such style and grace, 
Our highest hopes
I'm standing still, the running joke
Where goes the warm embrace 
It fades without return
Appears to slip through fingertips 
And burn

Just look at you now, oh...
Look at you now, oh...
Look at you now, oh...
Look at you now, oh...
Now...

Two glass eyes
I'll fuckin' tell you lies
I'm on the side of the road
You won't fuckin' die

Yeah, yeah
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow

Fuck this road
Well, fuck you too
I'll fuckin' kill your best friend
What you fuckin' gonna do

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Pow


From the moment you said "why haven't you kissed me yet?"
I knew I'd wipe that paint from your lips
I stare the lids off your eyes, gone down on your dirty mind

&
end up between you hips
Handfuls of sweat tangled hair, anytime, anywhere
I want to lick you too much baby
I just play all alone, whispering for your moan
Forced to crawl down this line, just to touch

I can get in
I can't get out
I'm just sweating my sheets
I hate to see you leave, but I love to watch you go baby
Twisted secret lives, the way you bat your eyes
Givin head givin head givin head

Watch you come from above
I'm so needy for love, I'm desperate,
Greddy in slavery
I sneak around from behind
I got a one track mind
We got a skin on skin thing baby
I want to lick you too much
I hear you comin ooh aaaah baby


It's all in motion
No stoppin' now
I've got nothin' to lose
And only one way up

I'm burning bridges
I destroy the mirage
Oh, visions of collisions
Fuckin 'bon voyage

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

I got bruises and hickies
Stitches and scars
Got my own theme music
It plays wherever I are

Fear is the hand
That pulls your strings
A useless toy
Pitiful plaything

I'm inflagranti
In every way

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
That needs gettin' done

God only knows
Where love vacations
If reason is priceless
There's no reason to pay for it

It's so easy to see
And so hard to find
Make a mountain of a mole hill
If the mole hill is mine

I hypnotize you
And no one can find you
I blow my load
Over the status quo
Here we go

I'm a little bit nonchalant
But I dance
I'm risking it always
No second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done yeah

God only knows
So mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions
Of your lord and savior

Every temple is gold
Every hook is designed
Hell is but the temple
Of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

Shut up

Pow!


Once you're lost in twillights's blue
You don't find your way, the way finds you...

Tempt the fates, beware the smile
It hides all the teeth, my dear,
What's behind them...

So glad you could stay
Forever

He steps between the trees, a crooked man
There's blood on the blade
Don't take his hand

You warm by the firelight, in twilight's blue
Shadows creep 
&
dance the walls
He's creeping too..

So glad you could stay
Forever


It's late enough to go drivin
And see what's mine
That's a study of dying
How to do it right
You're a holy roller
Get your bed in the loose
If you're hanging around
I'm holdin' the noose

Come a little bit closer
And get on tight
In a horse rollin' over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

Come on, let's go drivin'
Come on, let's take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right


[Instrumental]


I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I've been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Burned and buried all I carried
All my evils through a needle
As it pulled through the eye 
What was and will are all gone

Don't sweat it
Thread to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Take a picture, bury it all away
Bury it all away

Tried to fake it, I just can't take it
I don't care if it hurts
Just so long as it's real
I won't waste it, turned to face it
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull
Tried explaining, done explaining
Got caught in the plaid
All this talking at once
I've been giving my love away
To the things that tear it apart
I'm gonna suture up my future

Thread to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away
It's like this, it's like this


I slipped,
Didn't mean to do it that way.
But I blew in on a whim, gone tomorrow?
I've gone today

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Come,
Lets play it loud and let each other lose
A win would cause an alarm
Don't matter to me
Don't matter to you

Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know
You gotta be free
So free yourself

I could keep you all for myself
I know
You gotta be free
So free yourself

Self inflicted wound, your gift,
Impeccable aim
Can really clear a room
All the bodies piled up in your way

Oh yeah it hurts so bad
Oh oh oh oh yeah

I could keep you all for myself
I know
You gotta be free
So free yourself

I could keep you all for myself
I know
You gotta be free
To kill yourself


Every day I wake up,
Feeling this way.
I take it down town
With all the action going down
I strike a match,
Strike a match.
Work it up!

I'm feeling so sick
I feel so fucking sick
On the bathroom floor
Gotta get out and get right
Hustling little girls
Cheating little boys,yeah
Gotta get out, gotta get out
Get right
Gotta get out
I gotta get out
No more
No more
No more

I'm feelin' so sick
On the bathroom floor
I'm feelin' so sick
No more

Yeah

I'm feelin' so sick
Sick
On the bathroom floor
Sick 
No no more


(Instrumental)


I saw you, in a way
Beyond figure out
These lines of life have been drawn 
can't be removed
Our eyes is all it took to know

Open up your eyes
Deep blue, glassy take

swim 'til water 
sky
Now are one, out of two
Oh, my bloodshot eyes

Open up your mouth
Touch your lips to mine
That we may make a kiss that can pierce through death 
survive
Your words have branded my mind

Still i hold your hand
Wrapped as if a ring
We of flesh 
blood are only carrying
It's so hard to

Well, you know

The seed waits for the reaper to sew
Every breath an art
The dignity to it can strain 
break your heart
Take all your pieces home
You ask when you're alon, "what is love"
The blood is love


I've been waiting
Waiting under things
That rise in the morning
I've been holding
Holding back so long
You can own it
Take it off my hands
Do me a favor
Nothin' wasted
Just fingerfucked and
Busted up all at once

I'm so lost out on the highway
With no direction left to go
Everyday sit up and wonder
Where it was I started from

The more you've found
The less you've been around


Going on a living spree
Plenty wanna come with me
You don't wanna miss your chance
Near-life experience
Faces making noise
Say, be good girls and boys
It ain't half empty or full
You can break the glass, or drink it all
Dig it

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

A glamour cabaret
The last float on parade
'Cause their swing got left behind
Every puzzle piece of mind
Handshake in facade
Play the fool or playing God
Just for God's sake play along
Well, you can have a laugh, hit it
Du-du-du-du-duah
Duuu-du-dudu
Du-du-du-du-duah
Du-du-du-duu-du-dudu
Duuu-du-dudu

Dive in
Falling no different
I am far beyond definitions now
Commence

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

Go on a living spree
You really wanna come with me
They couldn't miss the chance
Near-life experience

Move on
We're all entangled
Oh oh, let the man go
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go
Yeah, unfold, let it go

Here we come

Here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta the way
Here we come
Get outta the way
Matters not
What the people say
Matters not
What the people say
'Cause here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta the way, yeah


Got guns 
Do you wanna take aim at each other?
Scratch the itch? Give the finger?
'Cause we don't care

Anyway

Got knives,
Have you seen 'em?
In your back's where we keep 'em
And your never gonna reach 'em
Now that sounds fair

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could

How you like your position?
You ain't Robert Mitchum
You say you give and you give
Why don't you just give in?

Tra la la

Young, dumb, drinkin semen
Small pond kind of dreamin'
If you don't like the raft,
Why don't you take a swim?

Ooh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Ooh, how can you win?
Against yourself again


Well I've got a secret, I cannot say
Blame all the movement to give it away
You've got somethin', I understand
Holding it tightly, caught on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

I look for reflections, in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner, locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Still can't believe there is a lie
Promises promise, an eye for an eye
We've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell

I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm taking this all to the grave

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell


Here comes the one that you've been dreaming of
I am the most exalted potentate of love
I got a mojo hand that fits like a glove
I'll be coming around the mountain to get your love
I'm the most exalted potentate of love
Yes I am

Yes, I'm the celebrated hottentot of twat
Make a hole, look out, make way for a demon child
I'll make you hear my turtledove
Ride around the range to get your love
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun

Mad, you called me mad?
I have the secret to eternal love
Mad, you call me mad?
I am the most exalted potentate of love

Yes, I'll teach you how to read the book of life
You can just look at the pictures if you like
I'll make you hear my turtledove
Ride around the range to get your love
Are we having fun on a fire son of a gun

I am the most exalted potentate 
The most exalted potentate
The most exalted potentate of love


Huh, what?


The sky is falling
Human race that we run
It left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
Only a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to today

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's all deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
Only a moment I notice
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
Not to go back to the low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling


I want God to come and take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here, it is as I feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all is far behind
The vampire of time and memories has died
I survived. I speak, I breathe,
I'm incomplete
I'm alive - hooray!
You're wrong again
'Cause I feel no love

Does anyone ever get this right?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love, I feel no love


I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long, and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my mind
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done, 'til you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore


When I first met her she was seventeen
Seventeen
Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
Burned alive

We run 'til no one could find us
Girl, we outrun everyone

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Yeah

Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
They'll terrorize

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Now
The way you used to do

My heart, a ding-a-ling, a puppet on a string
C'est la vie
So lay your hands across my beating heart, love

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Used to do
Like the way you used to do
Come and love me now
Like the way you used to do
Like the way you used to do


[Instrumental]


Where O where have you been my love?
Where O where can you be?
It's been so long, since the moon has gone.
0 what a wreck you've made me.

Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there, up in the sky?
Until the return of my love
This lullaby

My Hope is on the horizon
Every face, it's your eyes i can see
I plead, i pray through each night 
day
Our Embrace is only a dream.

As sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left, I'd only begun this lullaby


You got the question? Please don't ask it
It puts the lotion in the basket
You say bigger's better, but bigger's bigger
White boy dressed up like a figure

Drawn inside a toilet on the wall
The world is round, my square don't fit at all

They say those who can't just instruct others
And act like victims or jilted lovers
You can't lose it if you never had it
Disappear, man, do some magic

Want a reason? How's about because
You ain't a has been if you never was

I sound like this

Scared to say what is your passion
So slag it all, bitter's in fashion
Fear of failure's all you've started
The jury is in, verdict: retarded

I'm so tired, and I'm wired too
I'm a mess; I guess I'm turning on the screw


With a pistol in both hands
He walked in like he had a plan 
Had the eyes of a dead man
Never seen such a blood fan 
Bodies twitching while ears ring 
Biding time while my heart stings 
Got twelve souls, sure of nothing 
Wait and see what hell brings 
Two tears in a bucket 
The river runs red 
Two tears in a bucket
Always fear for the undead
Always fear what I said


Scaredy nose Jack
Scaredy nose Jack
Knowing nothing about nothing
It's a blessing in fact

Acid-faced Jake
Acid-faced Jake
He like them dancing straight boys
Makes his pupils dilate

Does he come quick?
Does he come quick?
Tell the doctor to come over
Bring emergency kit

Abel loves scratch
Abel loves scratch
He drink the water from the gutter
It's a natural fact

Damn youth
You could be young again
I know
Be un-reborn again
A skull

Frozen in pose
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth
You can almost reach

Frozen in pose
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth
You can almost reach
Well people

Well, Tracey gon' shake
Tracey gon' shake
Teeth, before we pull out 
C'est magnifique on the way

Twizzy gon' twitch
Twizzy gon' twitch
He said no huggee, no kissee
Until I get a weddin' ring

K-dub cuts quick
Taking no shit
Give a metal blowjob
Middle finger and split

Youth
You could be young again
I know, be un-reborn again
Lifeless in my hands
You could be skeletons
Under the X's
Beyond it, where it lives
Let's go

Frozen in pose
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth
I can almost reach

Frozen in pose
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth
I can almost reach

Frozen in pose (I had a vision as clear as day)
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth (delusions of grandeur and [?])
I can almost reach

Frozen in pose (every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth)
Locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth (everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth)
You can almost reach

Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh

Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh

There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Come drink from the water before it's been drained away
Every drop like an ocean, every moment a [?]
Delusions of beauty left to [?]
There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm, mmm-hmmm-hmmm


I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long, and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my mind
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done, 'til you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore


I don't think I am what I was before
Cause I never watched anyone die before
I wish I'd never left home
I wish I'd left it alone
Temptation is a disease
Cause you never do as you please
Your body takes over and your mind don't care
Never think twice what might happen out there

Screamin

Go straight in for the ultimate sin
Nobody else ever seems to care
So I took what I thought was mine
And waited for a very long time
And I thought I knew what happened to you
You told me exactly what to do
So I did it right, stayed up all night
Felt like killing myself for you

I don't think I think like I did before
I never watched anyone die before
I felt like I died as well
The look, the words, the smell
The way you looked at me
As if I'd never been free
I remember the words like a favorite song
Cause I forget the way things went wrong
Faked a picture of perfect health
I realised I was killing myself

I don't think I am what I was before
I never watched anyone die before
I dream in slow motion and I wake up screaming

Screamin


Got some action on the other side
Loose teeth in my head
New programs are coming in
So rise and take your oath
I wish we could get away
Drink wine and screw
I knew someone else before
Looked a lot like you

[Chorus]
And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

I been programed as I said before
Technology
Just rollin', wheezin' and breathin'
Eyeballs and teeth
Words are weightless here on earth because they're free
You knew someone else before
Looked a lot like me

[Chorus: x2]


Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
Hey little sister, shotgun
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, shotgun

It's a nice day to start again
Come on, it's a nice day 
For a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

Take me back home

Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister,
Who's the only one? (only one)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long

It's a nice day to start again
Come on, it's a nice day 
For a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

And there's nothing sure in this world
There is nothing safe in this world
And there's nothing sure in this world
And there's nothing pure in this world
Look for something left in this world

Start again

Come on, it's a nice day 
For a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
Come on, it's a nice day
For a white wedding


Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartache?
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you?
Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for you?

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade?
All your affections finally fade away
There will be no use inside
Who'll be the next in line for you?

One day you'll find out when I'm gone
I was the best one you had
I was the one who gave you love

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?
Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for you?

One day you'll find out when I'm gone
I was the best one you had
I was the one who gave you love

Who'll be the next in line?
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches?
Who will make the same mistakes I made over you?
There will be no use inside
Who will next in line for you?

For you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you
For you


It's a mistake, but who knows
Followed you home, crawled in your window
This life is a trip when you're psycho in love
And I know

Followed your friends, you were not there
Slashed and I cut, I bled in the sink
Heard what you said and you're laughing maybe
Slashed and I cut, and I do it for you
I want you to notice when I'm not around
Wherever you are

You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell
You're solid gold
I'll see you in hell


I don't mean to make a scene
But even the mob know what the hell I mean
The knot is tight on my blindfold
I got my flesh full of blood
I hate rock and roll

Some think too much
And come too soon
I just curse the sun
So I can howl at the moon

Don't wanna love you no more
Don't wanna love you less
I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress
What's the fuckin' difference
We all gonna die
You gonna do something kid?
Oh come on give it a try

Got no big plans but a good idea
Let's split this town and run everywhere
Yeah I got enemies
But they don't know
They won't get no glory
On that side of the hole

Well united by drifting alone
This is the army of none
Got no flag, got no home
Just riches and scabs
And awfulness
I confess
Let's do it again, said


I play a game till im dead
Or on a magazine
I want to look like im dead
Dancing on the string 

I eat the food when it's dead
Make a mess of things
Get that look
Everywhere 

But keep that look
Off my face 

Everybody else want to fall in love
Theres no room for love
In a violet sky
Living in the Era Vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights 

From a crumbling tower
I see everything
London, Tokyo, New York City 

There's no love
There's no love
There's no love
Any place 

Everybody else want to fall in love
Theres no room for love
In a violet sky
Living in the Era Vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights 

Are we creatures
Helplessly attacking repetition
Over, over 

Left with who we are
Did you tell anyone
Did you tell, any place 

Everybody else want to fall in love
Theres no room for love
In a violet sky
Living in the Era Vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights 

Living in the Era Vulgaris
Just drool in the dark
As you stare at the lights 

Just stare at the lights

Just stare at the lights

Just stare at the lights


Dead bull with the life from the low
I'll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Pressurize, neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more

Space flunky, four on the floor
Fortified with the liquor store
This one's down, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Shrunken head I love to adore
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
B-movie, gimme some gore

Gimme toro, gimme some more


Me just happy robot
Live on hill of beans
You and I cut from same cloth
Rippin' at the seams
Cut, snip, cut

Don't forget to remember
The devil's got pills in his eyes
Look, laugh, but don't touch
Cut you down to size
Cut, up, cut (shut up)
Cut, up, cut

You would know

My girl's all out of focus
I ain't no big surprise
Daddy got his gun loaded
Got cross hairs in his eyes
Shot up, oh 
Shot up, oh 

You would know

You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know
You would know


Clear-eyed girl
In a crooked way
All the crooked walkin
To avoid and evade
Hair like maple, skin like cream
Bet they say I love you
When you strip them thin
Chorus:
Baby, you'?re so vague
That you probably think this song ain'?t about you
Green eyed boys
Lick the razor blade
Girl I think I love you
And the mess you made
Setting you up
It don'?t get you down
When you flash your fangs
You own this town
Chorus:
Baby, you'?re so vague
That you probably think this song ain'?t about you



[Instrumental]


Just give me something to feel
I'm waking out of a dream
Never had to feel love
Never had to really know

Just give me some other way
I'm holdin on to the grave
Never had to realize
Never had a real love

I don't need no one
I don't want no one
I ain't got no one
Don't wanna be alone

Just give me somethin to pray
The light is slipping away
Never had a real love
Never had to feel alive

I don't need no one
I don't want no one
I ain't got no one
Don't wanna be alone


Left a flower in the spring
You know that I'm coming back
All the moments you were mine
I don't know what has become of you
But I know what's left
All the love you held inside

Beyond the stars there's no one alive
I know there's a way
This 20 hours since my sleep
I know you will stay
Until this moment, don't talk to me
A crisis away

Left the hour you descend into another time
All the words you held inside
I don't know what has become of you
But I know what's left
All my hope you would divide

Beyond the stars there's no one alive
I know there's a way
This 20 hours since my sleep
I know you will stay
Until this moment, don't talk to me
A crisis away

Today, my soul is unscathed
I can't touch the ground
La la la
Today, my soul is unscathed
I can't see the ground
La la la

Left a flower in the spring
You know your love won't last
All the moments you were mine
I don't know what will become of you
But I know what's left
All the time you have to find

Beyond the stars there's no one alive
I know there's a way
This 20 hours since my sleep
I know you will stay
Until this moment, don't talk to me
A crisis away


No one knows her name but they see her youth and use her
She's feeling free and everything she sees is truth
She's seventeen, she's got everything she needs to lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh no

She's got everyone to help her on her way
She's got everyone to help her on her way
She's got everyone to help her on her way down

He seems to know right where it hurts, your pain, in vain
He gives himself to you, he's in your way
And everything he does just seems a phase, insane
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh no

He's got everyone to help him on his way
He's got everyone to help him on his way
He's got everyone to help him on his way down

Everything you touch tears at your heart, apart
Of everything you see is down in your soul, never let you go

You've got everyone to help you on your way
You've got everyone to help you on your way
You've got everyone to help you on your way down

you're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do, sir?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do, sir?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do? How do you do?

You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do, sir?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do, sir?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do, sir?
You're a 666 conducer, how do you do the things you do?
How do you do the things you do? How do you do?
How do you do? How do you do? How do you do?


Hey little darlin'
Don't you feel like callin'?
I can't wait for nothin'
There ain't nothin' been new

We're gone
We're gone from the others
I can't see no other
With you in my mind

The bottle's been callin'
The bottle's been tempting
The bottle's been tending
To killin' this time

Umm-mm
Seems a fine way to lose
Seems a fine excuse
When I can't choose you

Take
Take it all by the morning
Asleep in the moments
I keep it away

The bottle's been calling
The bottle's been tempting
The bottle's been tending
To killin' this time

Seems a fine way to lose
When I can't choose you


(instrumental)

Some say there's no way

Where's my dream baby
I'll never see it come till it's all gone away
Where's my dream baby
I'll never see it coming till it's all gone away
Where's my love baby
I'll never see it come till it's all gone
Where's my love baby
I'll never see it coming till it's all gone

It's all gone away
It's all gone
It's all gone
It's all gone away

Where's my dream baby
I'll never see it come till it's all gone away
Some say it's all gone away

The time has come you're older now
Take the time to hold her now
The time has come you're older now
Take the time to hold her now
The time has come you're older now
Take the time to hold her now


It's easy to fall in love
When you fall in love you know your done
You got easy eyes to hunt 
When the world above needs your blood

And the cold vain to the richest man
They're paid away to steal our hand

There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

It's easy to fall in love
When your on your luck you know your done
And the last kiss had a foolish cause
Straight tired eyes could only haunt

There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out

There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
There ain't no easy way no there ain't no easy way out
It's easy to fall in love when you fall in love you know your done


Maybe I was yours to keep
Burning in the eyes you heap
Someday I will take your hand
Moving through another land

And every single second tears
This even from the love you had
But I'll be right behind your eyes
Turning to a love you hide

And every single breath you take
Will be haunting, oh
Against the weight

Maybe I was 'sposed to fall
Turn into a shining star
Every single heart forgive
Must've filled the arms of grace before

I'll be right behind your eyes
Working through the words you light
Till every single one's betrayed  
I'll be holding on against the weight 

Moments only seem to pass
Days are never born to last
Without you I never had a chance
From the moment you left my hand
I was trying to be someone I can't
But she wouldn't let you back
Now I'm tired of waiting for you tonight

Hanging on a single breath
Screaming 'til there's nothing left
It's just all we'll ever find
Broken as all our minds


Help yourself, don't say a thing
Your love won't show
In anything at all
If all you do is talk

Sadly, I remain in need
Of all the things you say
But leave in speak
All you do is talk

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky words don't bleed

You time the end of all we see
You say we're on our way
And all will be
Alone in everything

You say it's all we'll ever need
You've found an easy way
But still you weep
Alone in everything

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky words don't bleed

Help yourself, don't say a thing
What love you show
Won't mean a thing at all
If all you do is talk

Sadly, we remain to see
What brings an end
Is also what we need
All you do is talk

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
You're lucky words don't bleed


Nothing seems to show
The feelings come and go
And everything? s so strange
The people never change

Am I only, only one of you? 
Am I only, only one of you? 

Emotions never known
They talk through what you show
So easy, you let go
What's left is torn and thrown

Am I only, only one of you? 
Am I only, only one of you? 

You turn into a song
And everything feels wrong
There's so much more to see
But lost is meant to be

Am I only, only one of you? 
Am I only, only one of you? 

Am I the only lonely one of you? 
Am I the only lonely one of you? 
Am I the only lonely one of you? 
Am I the only lonely one of you? 
Am I the only lonely one of you?


Close your eyes to the world that you see
And open wide to the one in your dreams
There's nothing left that you wanna believe
Foreign eyes have been torn at the seams

You'd save yourself from a world without sin
You're born again with a means to an end
You're drawing lines in the palm of your hand
You're holding on to all that you've planned

There's nothing here that is left to be saved
Take a bow to the warrior state
You throw yourself to the perilous static
You shut your eyes but the death is romantic

You've sold your soul but it's only a fake
You'd kill yourself for a piece of the take
You lose your mind in a world that leaves nothin?
You're holding on for asylum, reaching for air

It's all you want, you know you'll never forget
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender
It's all you know, you know you'll never regret
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters

No one needs what they think to survive
You're pulled inside with an appetite blind
You feast your eyes on American sex
You sleep in shores of American bliss

Growing wings from the sorrowless excess
Your frozen eyes cut the chord to their last depth
You share your young with the wolves of a nation
There's nothing left till you pray for salvation

It's all you want, you know you'll never forget
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters
It's all you know, you know you'll never regret
Your open arms, they only seem to surrender all that matters


I can't wait for long, my darling 
All I have to keep me strong
All I have will go, 
All I have will go
And I move on, 
And I move on
And I am aching, 
And I'm aching

I can't wait for long I'm sorry, 
All I have has left me gone
I can't stay for long I'm sorry, 
All that's left kept me strong
And I move on, 
And I move on
And I am aching, 
And I'm aching
And I move on


(Instrumental)

It's just like heaven
Being here with you
You're like an angel
Too good to be true

But after all, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby
When you are near me
My heart skips a beat

I can hardly stand
On my own two feet
Because I love you
I love you, I do

Angel baby, my angel baby
Angel baby, my angel baby
Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I do

No one can love you
Like I do, ooh
From the first time that
I looked deep into your eyes
You sent me off to heaven, baby

Body and mind
Everything about you is
Everything that I've dreamed of
And now you're here beside me

My angel from above
No cambiaria una cosa
De ti aunque pudiera
Porque tu heres, mi angel

Angelito mio
Nunca me dejes solay sinti
Que sintu amor, no quiero vivir
Porque te quiero, te quiero eserio
Angel mio, mi angelito

It's just like heaven
Here with you, dear
I could never stay away
Without you near

Because I love you
I love you, I do

Angel baby, my angel baby
Angel baby, my angel baby
Ooh, I love you
Ooh, I do

No one can love you
Like I do, ooh, ooh


It was many and many a year ago, 
In a kingdom by the sea, 
That a maiden lived there who you may have known,
By the name of Annabel Lee,
This maiden she lived with no other thought,
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child, 
In this kingdom by the sea,
We loved with the love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that long ago, 
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came,
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre,
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me-
Yes!-That was the reason (As all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we-
Of many far wiser than we-
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever the my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by side
Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,
In the sepulchre there by the sea, 
In her tomb by the sounding sea.


So now that everybody's gone 
You see no change has come 
In every song you've ever sung 
You find the words were wrong 

But now the time is gonna come 
And there's no feeling lost 
For everyone who could've loved 
And made me not to love 

And all the time 
I thought your words were mine 
You held me down 
As sure as the sun 
You held me down 
As sure as the sun 

Now I could see into your eyes 
But there's no compromise 
For anyone you coulda saved 
But never recognized 
And now your worries gonna fall 
But I won't help at all 
For everyone who sees the place 
Who knows they can't belong 

And all the time 
I thought your words were mine 
You held me down 
As sure as the sun 
You held me down 
As sure as the sun 

You've taken away 
Much more than you gave 
What keeps me down 
I'm lost in a rage 
No one can explain 
What keeps me down 
What keeps you down 

So now that everybody's gone 
You see no change has come 
In every song you've ever sung 
You find the words were wrong 

And every paper that you read 
You feel your spirit grieve 
For everyone who's gonna fall 
The distance another leaves 

And all the time 
I thought your words were mine 
You held me down 
As sure as the sun
You held me down
As sure as the sun

You've taken away 
Much more than you gave 
What keeps me down 
I'm lost in a rage 
No one can explain 
What keeps me down
What keeps you down


Cold wind wakes me from my
Sleep I've waited for this
Something for which I relied

Darkness takes me to my
Dreams I've waited for this
Something from which I can't hide

I'll never see it 'til it's at my door
'Til it's at my door, it will be ignored

I'll never see it 'til it's at my door
'Til it?s at my door, it will be ignored

Nothing seems to ease my
Conscience seems to be
Unconscious, all I have realized

Sorrow seems to eat my
Being, only leaves me
Seeing all I have is gone

I'll never see it 'til it's at my door
'Til it's at my door, it will be ignored

I'll never see it 'til it's at my door
'Til it's at my door, it will be ignored


want to feel what I touch 
want to find what was lost 
want to be kind 

As you see every curse 
And in a dream it'll work 
Now you'll feel tied 

want to praise with this life 
And conceal without lies 
I just need time 

want to fight every need 
Every push every string 
Will you stand by? 

I've been awake through the wrong decisions 
I've held the ground now I'm gaining soul 
I bit my tongue through the cold realizations 
I've been accused but I've only begun 

want to speak what I've seen 
want to reach what I've dreamed 
want to be kind 

want to seal what I've cut 
want to hear without rush 
want to ease time 

With your hand on your loss 
Our scene truly cost 
No one told you 

And we grew from the day 
Into night I'm ashamed 
I will join you 

I've been awake through the wrong decisions 
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul 
I bit my tongue through the cold realizations 
I've been accused, but I've only begun 
Take me on, take me on 
I've been awake, shaking to a rage 
I've been awake, shaking to a rage 

In the end only once 
All you need is a touch 
want to see love 

Every thought you'll be shown 
Every act will be known 
I defend you 

We'll awake every sound 
Every chance I'll be found 
I'll be with you 

To the end now you come 
Show your hands to the ones 
To behold you 

I've been awake through the wrong decisions 
I've held my ground now I'm gaining soul 
I've held my tongue through the cold realizations 
I've been accused, but I've only begun 
Take me on, take me on 
I've been awake, shaking to a rage 
(Take me on, take me on) 
I've been awake, shaking to a rage


She's a reckless lover with blood stained hands
'Round the neck of her, helpless man
She's the midnight silence, an outbound train
She's the glory of fallen names

Aya
Aya
We're alone
There's no room here anymore
Aya
Aya
We're alone
And there's no room here anymore

She's a patient killer, a timeless hand
The choke of the falling sands
She's a proven saint with a witch's tongue
The gods of war at her command

Sweet Aya bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone

Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore

She's the broken shadows on the fallen walls
With no master there's no call
She's the faithful silence that visits all
With no mercy, no remorse

Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore

Sweet Aya bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Sweet Aya bring it on
I wanna kiss you till they're gone
Till they're all gone

Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya
Aya
We're alone and there's no room here anymore
Aya

We're alone


Everything just falls away, just give it back into your arms
So many pieces fall away, just give '??em back into your heart
I feel that one more day is gone, you may never see the dawn
But nothin' ever stays the same, it's fighting you at every turn

Like a door that never opens wide, you just get kicked until your heart's bled dry
The road is gone but there's a line you cross, and I don't think you'll stop

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Bad blood and feelings

So many pieces fall away, just give '??em back into your heart
So many people fall away, just let them go into the dark
And every night I stay away, the feelin' running through my blood
But all I've got is faith and science, a line that will only blur

Like a door that never opens wide, 
You just get kicked until your heart's bled dry
The road is gone but there's a line you cross, and I don't think you'll stop

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Bad blood and feelings

I'm not slave to a world I could never save, 
As the light just disintegrates in the final hour
You never felt you were so alive, and you thought it could never die,
Now you just look back and wonder why it could never be

I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
I could see it in your eyes and now it's gone
With bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Just bad blood and feelings
Bad blood and feelings


You have forsaken all the love you've taken
Sleepin' on a razor there's nowhere left to fall
Your body's aching, every bone is breakin'
Nothin' seems to shake it, it just keeps holdin' on

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Your soul is able, death is all you cradle
Sleepin' on the nails, there's nowhere left to fall
You have admired, every man desires
Everyone is king when there's no one left to pawn

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

There is no peace here, war is never cheap dear
Love will never meet here, it just gets sold for parts
You cannot fight it, all the world denies it
Open up your eyelids, let your demons run

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

I thread the needle through, you beat the devil tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil's tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil's tattoo

I bled the needle through, you beat the devil tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil's tattoo
I bled the needle through, you beat the devil tattoo
I thread the needle through, you beat the devil's tattoo


Have a little love, as were fighting with each other 
Ain't no use in crying like the others 
Were fools in need, fools to believe, 
There are fools in need, to foolish to believe 

I'm gonna, uh somebody, uh somebody
Uh somebody, uh somebody 

here but don't you please, I've got time and time to bleed 
It ain't no use in trying to deceive 
I've been fooled by the lover, fooled by the sinner, fooled myself into thinking I was living 

I'm fighting just to breathe as I get back off my knees 
Help me somebody 
Help me somebody 
I'm fighting just to breathe as I get back off my knees 
I'm gonna, uh somebody, uh somebody, uh somebody, uh somebody 

She said 
Suicides easy, what happened to the revolution 
Suicides easy, what happened to the revolution 
Suicides easy, what happened to the revolution

heavy little lovers, as were fighting with each other 
Ain't no use in suffering like the others 
Were fools in need, fools to believe, 
There are fools in need, to foolish to believe 

I'm fighting just to breathe as I get back off my knees 
Help me somebody

There's no one ready for this, and for this
Our calls are all faded and disheveled
There's no one waiting on this, and on this
They call us all, lift us from the start

Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

There's no one ready for this, before this
We'll call this all, left us in the shadows
There's no more waiting for this, and for this
What calls us all, tears us all apart

It's something carried from the start
As long as I can wait I can see
It's something buried in the heart
What you've taken I have given for free
Take what you want
Take what you need
You take all, 'til all can't breathe

There's no one ready for this, and for this

My eyes are empty, my soul is pretty
You can ease it to me
I just need your empty mind
My eyes are thick and my skull is itchy
And I read no fiction
Is it me or everything in my bones?

My head is sinking and my love is pretend  
Is it real, no fiction
I just need your empty mind
My mind electric, my soul reflected
I can hear the ticket
Am I real, aren't you the fool

I'm still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still as lost as I'm found
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown

My love's a stick shift   
I can squeeze or make it
Is it real, or just a dream of mine?
My blood is tipping, my horse is limping
I can ease, or sink in
I just need some grand design

I'm still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone as a clown
Still alone, I'm
Still alone, still
Still alone, better ground

Oh, that's what I found
Oh, that's what I found
Oh, that's what I found
Oh, that's what I found
Oh, that's what I found


Can't change all the things I've done, I know
I'm chasing the reason and my soul
I feel it gone, I feel it gone

I've been waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind

I've been here a thousand times, I know
I thought that the point was to take it slow
Now I know what you said was true
I feel it gone, I feel it gone

I've been waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
And I feel it all

there's nothing left of this
They steal your innocence
There's nothing left of this
What use is innocence?
There's nothing left of this

I'm drowning in my own disease
Now I know it, now I see
I feel it all, I feel it all

I've been waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind
Waiting for the right time, just to begin
I'm feeling like the cold, cold wind

Yeah, you're awake and you know it ?cause you hit the ground
(Yeah, you're awake and you know it ?cause you hit the ground)
Yeah, you're awake and you know it 'cause you hit the ground
(Yeah, you're awake and you know it ?cause you hit the ground)
Yeah, we're awake and we know it 'cause we hit the ground
(Yeah, we're awake and we know it 'cause we hit the ground)


Well everything's so different now, this scream which fills the air,
And haunts the hall which children sleep upon the floor,
They'll have the gun, you'll hear them say with smiles meant to cry,
As they wind the watch strapped on the wrist and quickly look away,
And four and six have come and gone, five times before this scene,
And upon the lips of everyone, the curse I've never dreamed,
Yeah, upon the lips of everyone, the curse I've never dreamed.

It's a complicated situation,
It's a complicated situation mama,
I'm a complicated situation.

The young must be our sacrifice, they say with crippled grins,
The eyes of youth must lose their way and stumble here within,
So the sleeping children were awoke, in time to haze their eyes,
So it's never known on which they choke's worth books of old and time,
So it's never known on which they choke's worth books of old and time.

It's a complicated situation,
It's a complicated situation mama,
I'm a complicated situation.


I'm a constant sinner
A conscience killer
I'm a righteous heartache, never gonna let you get close to mine
I'm a punk every time, give me a little room and I'll spit in your eye

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers

I'm a red-blooded sickness
There was no way around it
I'm a fine line teaser, never been nothing but a cheater
I'm a son of the night, give a little room and I'll spit in your eye

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers
Don't want no conscience at all

I'm nails
I'm a knife
I'm a preacher with a gun, I'm a one man lie
I'm a king
I'm a ruse
I'm born again with no life to lose

Cause it don't mean all that much does it boy
We never really had a choice
No it don't mean all that much to us boy
We never really had a choice
We're conscience killers
Don't want no conscience at all


Out on the corner with cast iron blood
10,000 more with hearts on their own
The say I might die I maybe cold
I may have no Jesus I may have no soul
In prison I hear there's time to be good
But the first thing you see is the last thing you should

Well I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been told
Well I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been sold

They say there's a path soon where I'll stand to judge
But the devils a waiting with Christ like a son
When the look comes your way best say was I
For the reasons you hold give reasons to die
The callings impatient but the calls never won
But the last one to say it may last through the flood

Well I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been sold
Well I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life I have here is the life I've been told

And born in the mirror where life's just begun
And I've roamed from the reasons and roamed to the gun
They say I'm the killer and thy will be done
And the doors won't be open when I finally become

And I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been sold
Yeah I've seen the battle and I've seen the war
And the life laying here is the life I've been told


Done me wrong
Done all wrong
All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite long

Done all wrong
Done me wrong
All the wrong I've done
I'm sure I'll live quite, quite long

All the wrong I've done
Will be undone in song
All the wrong I've done
Will be undone in song

If you're doing wrong
If you've done all wrong
You can rest assure
You're gonna live quite long

If you've done all wrong
You're doing wrong
You can rest assure
You're gonna live quite, quite long

All the wrong you've done
Will be undone in song
All the wrong you've done
Will be undone in song

We're doing wrong
We've all done wrong
If we do no wrong
I'm sure we would be gone


Take your lonesome soul 
To the place I hear 
Where your freedom comes 
And nobody cares 
Lead your woes away 
They're only here 
If you stay down here 

Down here they say 
There's a game to play 
There's a place to go 
Where you learn how to pray 
No one seems to care 
But they'll give you 
A stare down here 

They're gonna steal your breathe
So give it away
They're gonna steal your mind
So give it away
They're gonna steal your soul 
So give it away
Down here


Maybe you're a little fire
You've been drowning your own desires
But every time I see you smile, the heavens move

Someday you will make it out
And you'll feel your heart break the sound
But if you're scared where prayers are found
I'll be with you, alone in that room

Be still my love
I don't wanna tear you down
Everybody knows my love
Everybody breaks somehow
Don't throw it all away my love
I'll be your all for now

Someday you'll return to silence
With a thousand miles of cave inside us
But every time I feel the quiet
It echoes you

Someday you will make it out
And you'll feel the walls tearing down
If there's a place where lost is found
I'll wait for you, alone in that room

Be still my love
I don't wanna tear you down
Everybody knows my love
Everybody breaks somehow
Don't throw it all away my love
I'll be your all for now

I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
All I've ever known echoes why
Listen to the well
Listen to the ground
I just wanna fade under the sound

I don't wanna run
I don't wanna hide
All I've ever known echoes why
Listen to the well
Listen to the ground
I just wanna fade under the sound

Until we drown


Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love

So in anger I challeneged his right
For the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered
In less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger
Lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood
There in silence
Shocked by the foul evil
Deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind
As I stood there
I had but one chance and
That was to run

Out through the back door
Of Rose's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one
He looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride.
Just as fast as

I could from the West Texas
Town of El Paso
Out through the badlands
Of New Mexico
Back in El Paso
My life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life
Nothing is left

But it's been so long since
I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than
My fear of death.

I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart
And at last here

I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rose's Cantina below
My love is strong and it
Pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see
Five mounted cowboys
Off to my left
Ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting
I can't let the catch me
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully
wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to
Stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong and
I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary
I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of
smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go
Deep in my chest

From out of nowhere
Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she
Kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving
Arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and
Felina, goodbye. 


I'm waiting for you to say
The words to make me stay
As you're walking out the door
My heart steps on the floor
I never dreamed it'd be
Make me feel so free
Waiting for you to say
The words to make me stay
As you're walking out the door
My heart steps on the floor
I never dreamed it'd be
Make me feel so free

Sure feels like love again
Sure feels like love again
I wanna feel again
Sure feels like love again

Waiting for you to say
The words to make me stay
Standing here alone
I should have never shown
I never should have dreamed
The feelings that are free

Sure feels like love again
I wanna feel again
I wanna feel love again
Sure feels like love again

I'm waiting for you to say
The words to let me stay
Standing here alone
I never should have shown
I never was the one
To leave it so undone

Sure feels like love again
I wanna feel again
Sure feels like love again
I wanna feel


I watched you look through the few
Just like you told me you'd do
And now you live for the star that you reflected to use
I never noticed the time, but now it's start to unwind
The few who know me for nothing
Well why did you lie?

As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein
Heaven's never gonna cry
As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein

I watched you look for the days that I don't want you to see
I've only failed in the ways that I don't want to believe
And now the day has begun
And it will burn like the sun
'cause I can see underneath your sacred hands are for none

I, I

As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein
Heaven's never gonna cry
As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein

It feels like, nowhere
It feels like, nothing

I never wanted to go
But now it's harder to close
Are we hearing our bodies or are we hearing our souls?
I watched you dead in a box
But since I'd rather you rot
There's nothing left to discuss
So why we lie on the turf

As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein
Heaven's never gonna cry
As you blacken my name
As you poison my vein.


I've been waitin' on the fault line
Let the needle take me on
I'll be standing with my dyin' bell
If you care to come along
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door

I've been lyin' in the bright lights
See my shadow from below
Never wanted from another man
Never wanted from my own
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door
Drownin' in the risin' tide in my father's door

Through a window to the last mile
Little picture on the wall
From the banks on the far side
See the lights come ashore
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' from the risin' tide to my father's door
Racin' with the risin' tide to my father's door


And all my sorrows awaken
And all my fear's run down
I turn myself into an angel
I run myself into the ground

I'm on my own I'm sure I'll feel it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll know it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll feel it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll know it now

And all the reasons invading
Twist and turn my aching soul
I leave myself behind in pieces
I know you'll need them when I'm gone

I'm on my own I'm sure I'll know it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll feel it now

I'll never see again
I'll never see again
The worst has come I'm fallin' in
I'll never see you again
I'll never see you again
The worst has come I'm fallin' in

I'm on my own I'm sure I'll feel it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll know it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll feel it now
I'm on my own I'm sure I'll know it now


Your love was always yours to give 
We'll start another war 
But you're always wondered perfectly 
What you're living for 

Your eyes have wept a thousand tears 
You never needed mine 
The crime is never what you steal 
But what you leave behind 

And maybe I'm too blind to see 
The line was always crossing me 
And maybe I'm too far to reach 
But what's inside of you still same as me, oh

When the soul dies it burns like the page
We pass through the gates
We pass through the gates
We pass through the gates
We pass through the gates
We pass through the gates
We pass through the gates

Your soul was only yours to keep 
It's barely in you now.
The bullet from the shell it leaves
Strips it to the ground.

And maybe I'm too blind to see 
the fire is all that walks with me 
And maybe I'm too starved and weak 
But what's inside of you still same as me, oh

It's a place where we all belong, gives rise to our very own
It's a call in the air we breathe, a sign to the everything
It's a call from where we've gone, to a place we've always known
It's a sign everywhere you go, it's a call when all have gone

To the place where all are from, it's a call to our very own
Gives rise with everyone, it's a path we've always known
Gives way to everything, gives rise to the night
Gives way to the everything, takes hold to the all we know
Gives way to the night, gives rise to the everything


You stream through the dark and cut through the light of day 
You use him again to the games that you want to play 
Blood is a footstep, loud as deafening call 
For everyone since has been slowed down by law 

Blessing served to pieces, shake you out of your bones 
But all you hide, open your eyes 
And tell yourself you've been calling home 
I will arrive won't be the same 
There's no one safe from you 

I will arrive won't be the same 
There's no one safe from this
I will arrive won't be the same 
There's no one safe from this  

You stretch through the heart, you keep your eyes pushed out 
It eases your mind to know what you must become 
Your panic ensues, you panic until you drop 
Living let's you just pray that you forgot 

Blessing served to pieces, shake you out of your bones 
Love your prize an endless guise 
You tell yourself, you'll be calling home 

I will arrive won't be the same 
There's no one safe from you 
I will arrive won't be the same 
There's no one who will take by you


"I don't feel at home in this generation
The ones without a need they ain't got a reason
I've been feeling alone in this generation

I've had a realization
No one really listens 
Nothing's really there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you 
And your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma
You put the knife in our back 
And no one even cares

I've been feeling alone in this generation
I ain't found the need I ain't found the reason
I got nowhere to go in this generation

You're ready to take them on
You're ready to take them on
You're ready to take it
I've had a realization

Don't tell me to listen 
Nothing's ever there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you 
And your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma 
And the trick bag
You put the knife in our back 
And no one even cares

I think I've had enough of this generation

Ain't you bad enough
I think I had enough of this generation
The ones without a need they ain't got a reason
I don't feel at home in this generation

You're ready to take them on
You're ready to take them on
You're ready to take it

I've had a realization
No one really listens 
Nothing's really there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you 
And your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma
You put the knife in our back 
And no one even cares

Ain't you had enough
I've had enough

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John go do My will!"

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down

Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later God'll cut you down
Sooner or later God'll cut you down

Go tell that long tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down

I will walk with Jesus, till I can't go any more,

The fading light comes passing low
With the living done now down below
He stands me long in blackened ground
The hands grown strong now make no sound
And I ain't never seen no other Lord
He grind my bones to save my soul
No, I ain't never seen no other Lord
He grind my bones to save my soul
No, I ain't never seen no other Lord

I'm broken, and it's closing time
I've thrown it all in just to stay alive
And the good sun done left me dry
I've worked to believe
I've worked to die
And the cold rain come dancing on
Leave me standing broken and I am fading off
And I ain't never seen no other Lord
He grind my bones to save my soul
And I ain't never seen no other Lord
No I ain't never seen no other Lord

Jesus, let me tell you son
I'm running to your heaven
Can't you hear me coming?
An' the bright light's been fading off
The preacher tell me son I got to pay to talk
Sweet lord come carry me
They fail to impress
And I can't believe
And I ain't never seen no other Lord
He grind my bones to save my soul
No I ain't never seen no other Lord
I ain't never seen no other Lord
I ain't never seen no other Lord
He grind my bones to save my soul
No I ain't never seen no other Lord
No I ain't never seen no other Lord


You're ha ha high, babe
Can't keep it on the ground


We were close but we never made it home
We could see what we had and we let it go
Now it's miles away and cast in stone
Now we're miles away and casting stones

There's a fire, there's a fire on the road
It's a cruel world that lets us go

It's a place we can never call our own
It's a falling wind that calls our souls
It's a cruel world that lets us go
It's a cruel world that lets us go

It's a fool alone that carries gold
He'll find his own when he finds alone
Now it's miles away and cast in stone
Now he's miles away and casting stones

There's a fire there's a fire on the road
It's a cruel world that lets us go

It's a place we can never call our own
It's a falling wind that calls our souls
It's a cruel world that lets us go
It's a cruel world that lets us go

So where are they now to let us know
So where are they now to let us know
So where are they now to let me know

Falling through what's left of the fractions
Waking up the silence passing
Holding on to something you can't lose
Waiting for a sign of passion

I'm gonna catch them, I'm gonna catch them, never let go
I'm gonna catch them, I'm gonna catch them, never let go

Where are they now
Where are they now
Where are they now
Where are they now?


I got a fatal heart, I'm tried to living 
Got a tortured soul, I can't give it away 
Gonna find a line, to get me through to reason 
Gonna bury it all just to give it a name 

I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I'd say I told you so but I'd know you never listen 
You're the only one I ever can't assure 
There's a fine line between fool and heartache 
It's the fatal sign that makes heartache fools 

I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 

I got a traitors heart, I'm tired of living 
With a tattered soul I got no one to blame 
Gonna fall apart if I leave it to decision 
She's the only one that can take it away

I hate the taste that I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it again 
I hate the taste but I carry I'm believing 
Yeah I hate the taste but I'd do it all again 

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 

I carry all the mess want to dance with direction 
I'm as sick as it gets, I need you there 
I carry all the mess want to dance with direction 
I'm as sick as it gets, I need you there 
I'm a mess

I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there? 
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there?
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
I wanna ride with you 
Why won't you take me there?


Take yourself apart from me
Down into a flame
You're everything one could keep
You're worn with every face

Rapping like a scarecrow's wings, you unwind
I'm thrown to a seamless wave
And it's written on a sea of love
And it's all I can leave you, babe
'Cause the world was never yours
I just keep playing that restless haunt
Nothing I can change

Swallow what's still brave in you
Like metal in your jaw
Trying not to melt away
Beginning to unthaw

Dead flag, ship of fools you command
I'm trying not to wither away
And I'm wondering if I'll feel the grace
I'm trying to unlove this world
But it has no other place
I just keep playing that empty hand
Nothing I can cheat

Can you touch?
Can you stay?
Would you weep, for the day?
You knew when your eyes closed
But you knew when your eyes closed
Can you want?
Can you stay?
Would you reach, around me?

Light another melody
And drown into the sound
I've buried every living thing
Deeper than the ground


You feel, no one listens, before saying you're through 
You fear, nothing takes you as far as you'll go 

This song is not about you 
The life that stands without you 
Your body and blood 
Your body and blood 
You're leaving us all 

I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 

You feel, nothing ever stays the same as it was 
You'll take, no more remedies to force yourself true 
You say, every motion and fall fail you too 

This song is not about you 
The life that stands without you 
Your body and blood 
Your body and blood 
You're leaving us all 

I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations 
I keep my head up high to ease my mind 
Of all these true sensations


I walk without you but I need to believe
I've got my own eyes now and I you to see
There's no discretion in my voice 
And you need to stand clear
I've been falling out of time 
But I want you to hear

I don't think you care to know 
But you've taken out my heart and soul

They'll never break you but you keep it coming
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
I've gotta find a place to hide 
Where I know you won't go

Cause I don't think you care to know 
But you've taken out my heart and soul
Now I don't think you care to know 
But I gave my life to be your whore

I think your moment's come 
And if you feel this love you could save me
I fear my selfishness will be 
The end of this if you don't save me

I've never told you but I feel I must know
I've buried half my life 
In the same place you soared
I couldn't resurrect it I feel my arms break
I've got a long way left to go 
And you shown me no grace

Cause I don't think you care to know 
But you've taken out my heart and soul
And I don't you care to doubt it 
But I don't mind cause I've got time

I'd get on my knees if I could 
Beg you to see you could save me
I fear my selfishness will be 
The end of this if you don't save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

I'd get on my knees if I could 
Beg you to see you could save me
I fear my selfishness will be 
The end of this if you don't save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

I'd get on my knees if I could 
Beg you to see you could save me
I fear my selfishness will be 
The end of this if you don't save me
Save me
Save me
Save me


"You want to walk on my side
I'm the devil in disguise
That's just the way that it goes
I guess you didn't know

Keep me high, Keep me low
I don't want to tell you where I've been

You want to fade under my speed
I'm the one who's in your dreams
It's the sound that you burn
I guess you didn't learn

Keep me high, keep me low
I don't want to tell you where I've been

I used to move with my shadow still
Now I'm searching for your will
That's just the way that it goes
I guess you didn't know
But every night that I think of you
With every voice that she brings me
It's not pain that I'm feeling
It's just the hate that I fear, I'm fearing

Keep me high, keep me low
I don't want to tell you where I've been"


You try so hard to be cold
You try so hard to not show
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see

Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't want to give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going on

You try so hard to be heard
You try so hard to not hurt
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see

Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't want to give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going right

I don't want to be sad


(instrumental)


In like the rose that grows on your soul, 
Out of time now you're out for more
In like the stone that forms in your heart, 
Out of reach but you can't give up this time

I'm on a wire to see your star shine
I'm on a wire to see your star shine

In like the sun that falls on us all, 
Out of time but you can't let go
Into the dark you've stumbled alone, 
Out of sight now you can't return this time

I'm on a wire to see your star shine
I'm on a wire to see your star shine
I've been blind, 
I've torn out my eyes 
But I fear no more
I've been blind, 
You've turned from my side 
But I felt your voice

In like the cold that grows in your bones, 
Out of time now you can't go on
End of the road you've taken alone, 
Devils' hands will replace the ones I've known

I'm on a wire to see your star shine
I'm on a wire to see your star

Please darling, hear me darling, 
See darling you don't owe them nothing
I'm on a wire, 
I've taken your silence 
But can't no more
Please darling, hear me darling, 
See darling you don't owe them nothing
I'm on a wire you fade in the light 
Where I can't follow

Time, keeps this love alive but your hope is gone
Time, keeps this love alive but your hope is gone


You know you've got a lot to learn
You feel it but your heart won't burn
The fear is runnin' every nerve
You're turning to the ones you've hurt

And nothing ever satisfies
You're screamin' but your tongue's still tied
Starvin' but your love won't feed
Nothin' ever sets you free

You know you've got a long way down
You'll feel it when you hit the ground

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters

Pinned inside the walls of sound
Reachin' but your hands are bound
Cryin' but your love's so sweet
You're singin' but your heart still weeps

And no one ever seems to care
Feels [Incomprehensible] on air

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters

I can't wait for time to save us
And I can't break your fall forever
'Cause you always take, you always take too much
You always take, you always take too much

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters


She said, "You're killing the light
You'll never see it again"
"We come to suffer", I said
"I won't be fooled by the light
I won't be fooled by the lie"

The easy road lies in wait
Takes its toll and all it desires
Leads you blind, leaves you there
Takes your heart and leaves you in silence

Oh, look what you've started
Oh, look what you've started
Oh, look what you've started
Oh, we're all broken hearted

She said, "don't leave us behind
We'll never be here again
Our lives are closer this way
I won't be fooled by the light
I won't be fooled by the lie"

The easy road lies in wait
Takes its toll and leaves you in silence
Leads you blind, leaves you there
Takes your heart and all that you wasted

Oh, look what you've started
Oh, look what you've started
Oh, look what you've started
Oh, we're all broken hearted


Another hand on your heart, with borrowed time
Your skin was cold, your soul was ice
You only want what you tangle, inside your bones

Your head will blow, like a cannonball

How can you break if you got no bones?
How can you wag if you got no dog?

But all you want you just feel, no world outside
Stay with my bones, stay 'til you like
We're only plastic toys, break down to size
Stay with my bones, stay 'til you like

How can you break if you got no bones?
How can you wag if you got no dog?
I don't wanna waste my life
'Til the tables turn

Skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground
You're gonna skin it all down, to the ground

Skin it all down, to the ground
Gonna skin it all down, to the ground

Here's to the travelers on the open world

Here's to you my little love with blessings from above, let the day begin

Here's to the winners of the human race
Here's to the losers in the game
Here's to the soldiers of the bitter world
Here's to the water that's their names
Here's to you my little love let the day begin
Here's to you my little love with blessings from above
Let the day begin, day begin, day start

There's a lien on your dreams 
That keeps you going under 
And a hole in the floor 
That drops us all together 
You can fight all you like 
There's no way to hide 
All the lines on your face 
Show you've got no place in here 

As long as the setting sun will shine 
As long as the setting sun will shine 
As long as you fight! 

But it's the same every day 
It drives the world insane 
And the lies of mankind 
Burn you up inside 
But it hurts and what's worse 
There's no way to reverse 
When your mind wants to start 
Pulling you apart, baby 

'Cause I needed more, and I need it more 
Will you satisfy 
I needed more, I needed more 
But this is more than I ever wanted 

It's a joke and we hope 
Your pleading from a rope 
There's a sound comin' down 
That burns you to the ground 
But they feast while you sleep 
It marks you like a beast 
But they lie through their eyes 
How long can you take it, girl 

'Cause I needed more, and I need it more 
Will you satisfy 
I needed more, and I needed more 
But this is more than I ever wanted to believe in 

It's a shame how we pay 
But love is not a game 
And it works when it hurts 
But nothin' kills the pain 
It's a gas while it lasts 
It's knocks you on your ass 
Without passion, you're a fashion 
How long can you fake it, girl 

'Cause I needed more, and I need it more 
Will you satisfy 
I needed more, and I needed more 
But this is more than I ever wanted to believe in 

You're all I came here for 
You are my lonely soul 
You're all I came here for 
You are my lonely soul


Lord don't let me go down, will my soul be turned
Don't wanna me leave the ground till I'm done reaping
Lord you let me down but I will still reach in
Don't wanna spit me out, might as well be eaten

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Lord don't hold me down while I'm still creeping
I wanna shake the ground till I am done reaping
Lord do you hear me loud; unto my soul speaketh
Oh won't you let me out, you got the wrong creature

Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing gone wild
Little thing's gone wild

Why won't you let me love?
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love

Why won't you let me love?   
Won't you let me love?
I wanna flee your love
I want your creature love

Why won't you let me love?  
Won't you let me love?
I wanna eat your love
I'll be your peace for love

Why won't you let me love?
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love

Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)
Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)
Little thing gone wild (little thing's gone wild)

(Be your love, your creature love)

(Be your love, your creature love)

(Be your love, your creature love)

Why won't you let me love
Won't you let me love?
I wanna feel your love
I want your creature love


The lost generation's taking hold
The last generation keeping score
Gonna want to know who they're working for
You're gonna want to know who you're working for

You're living like a loaded gun
You better show your hands

The lost generation's keeping score
The last generation taking holes
Gonna want to know who they're working for
You're gonna want to know who you're working for

You're living like a loaded gun
You better show your hands


Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


Don't you try to explain all the words that you've made for love
But you can't even pray 'cause the words make you frail and hollow
Don't you cry to yourself just to feel like someone who's hit bottom
But you can't run away 'cause the hole that remains will follow

Don't you care just enough
Don't you feel your heart stop
But you can't know what you want
But what matters now is enough

It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out

Don't you sleep in the day just to dream it away for good
But I know you're afraid 'cause the best that you gave was not enough

Don't you care just enough
Don't you feel your heart stop
But you can't know what you want
But what matters now is enough

It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out
It's a long, a long way down on your own
It's a long, a long way out


Breaks in the light, on the shape that you see 
But the feeling in you heart, with every beat 
Lose your love, you don't need a thing 
Hold it in a word, and never speak 

Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
At all, at all 

Climbed so high, can't escape what you dream
Feel it in your bones but never ease
It's in your touch, but you can't feel a thing
You're trying not to look at the face you see

Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself, at all 

Won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Won't you lose yourself, at all 

Your still sun, your still sky
You still fall, you still rise

Tiny little lies replace what you need
I see it in your eyes but never reach
You can't keep quiet, you can't even scream
You hold it in your heart, but the rest you leave

Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself, at all 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Why won't you lose yourself 
Won't you lose yourself, at all

Your still sun, your still sky
You still fall, you still rise

It's all for you


Never thought I'd see her go away
She learned I loved her today
Never thought I'd see her cry
And I learned how to love her today
Never thought I'd rather die
Then try to keep her by my side

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

Nothing else can hurt us now
No loss, our love's been hung on a cross
Nothing seems to make a sound
And now it's all so clear somehow
Nothing really matters now
Now we're gone and on our way

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

She cuts my skin and bruise my lips
She's everything to me
She tears my clothes and burns my eyes
She's all I want to see
She brings the cold and scars my soul
She's heaven sent to me

Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me

Never thought I'd leave you like the way I do, yeah
Kiss my love and I wish you're gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you're gone
Never thought I'd leave you like the way that I do

Kiss my love and I wish you're gone
You can kiss my love and I wish you're gone
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me
Now she's gone love burns inside me


You are the sun to the earth 
You are the light of this world 
Won't you see 
Why won't you see 
You are an arm I cant reach 
You are the words I can't speak 
Won't you say 
Why wont you say 

I will walk till I've no shadow 
I will walk till I've no shadow 

You twist the light in your hands 
Losing thoughts so you move you can't give 
Reasons fall from every storm that you lived 
We move through the dark, helpless 

You are the quiet in my soul 
You are the pieces of gold 
Won't you shine 
Why won't you shine 

I will walk till I've no shadow 
I will walk till I've no shadow 
I will walk till I've no shadow


Can you scream the words I could never hear
Can you feel the silence begin to tear
But it just takes so much to make it real that it hardly matters
And if you could see inside yourself your world would shatter

My mama taught me better than that, don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back it would be fatal

Can you see a world you have never felt
When you sleep the nightmare becomes yourself
But it just takes so much to make you sick when your heart's a bullet
But if you could fill some lead in me you would pass through it

My Mama taught me better than that, don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back it would be fatal

Your soul keeps liftin' away
My world keeps turnin'
And it brings me down, yeah it brings me down
Oh you're so afflicted
Your love keeps burnin'
But it brings me down, yeah it brings me down

Can you scream the words I could never hear
When you speak the silence begins to tear
But it just takes so much to make you sick when your heart's a bullet
But if you could reach the edge in me, you won't break through it

My mama taught me better than that, don't play with angels
If my lost soul could be given back it would be fatal


I never wanted so much
I unleashed with the fury of a fire
I only wanted your touch
I am seen as a sinner and a liar

I never took you so high
I can feel all the traces of the sky
I never held you so tight
I conceal all the worst that you desire

You know it's true
I'm walking through the same broken world as you
But can't you see?
You're living in the same tangled web as me

I never wanted so much
I unleashed with the fury of a fire
I never meant you goodbye
I could bleed out the poison in your eyes

You know it's true
I'm walking through the same broken world as you
Can't you see?
You're living in the same tangled web as me

Martyr
Martyr
Martyr
Martyr


Time stands too still
Left you there for the kill
But this hope that sorrow bleeds
Leaves a man with nothing

There's just no mercy in your eyes
There ain't no time to set things right
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
I'm just a painful reminder
Another day you leave behind

Love grows a fear
Suites your taste of bitter ends
But this stake that holds you in
Leaves no place to begin

There's just no mercy in your eyes
There ain't no time for selling lies
And I'm afraid I've lost the fight
I'm just a painful reminder
Another day you leave behind

Words seem so blind
I've been pushed far aside
To my choice seems too small
Any move and I could fall

There's just no mercy in your eyes, child
There ain't no time to set things right
And I'm not preaching to the choir
I'm just a painful reminder
And you're a fool to satisfy


I spit my faith on the city pavement
To keep a smile
I bought my legs from the US Government
To keep me in line

We are the ones that keep you high
We are the ones that warm the sky
And you're burning bright


I filled my head with another replacement
To keep me high
I shot my soul when they wanted to take it
Your worst ain't mine

We are the ones that keep you down
We are the ones that warm the ground
While our arms surround

She's my river of sunshine, she's my girl
She can save the US, save the world
Yeah she's alright, I'll be fine
There's no US, save your mind
Save your mind 

I'll give you nothin if you're just gonna waste it
But that's alright
I'll give you love if your wanting the taste that 
leaves you behind

We are the ones that keep you high
We are the ones that burn your pride
And you're burning bright

Your Gonna Make It, Your Gonna Suffer
Your Gonna Make It, Your Gonna Suffer
We're Gonna Make It, Your Gonna Suffer
Your Gonna Make It, We're Gonna Suffer

I've been waitin for the sun to come, lead me through the gates of Rome
Your gonna know they were never, never yours to kill

I've been waitin for the sun to come, show you all what's being done
You're gonna know they were never, never yours to kill



You wanna pick somethin' up, you've gotta lay it down
You wanna turn somethin' on, you gotta set it off
You wanna let something in, you've gotta tear it out
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air

The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna feel the light, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground
I just need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

You wanna lift somethin' up, you've gotta pin it down
You wanna pull somethin' in, you gotta let it out
You wanna light something up, you've gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air

The only word that you know is please, please, please
The only life that you see is from your knees
I wanna turn it on, I just can't receive
Don't wanna leave the ground
I just need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

You wanna pick somethin' up, you've gotta lay it down
You wanna turn somethin' on, you gotta set it off
You wanna light somethin' up, you've gotta burn it down
I wanna feel the sun, I just need some air
I need some air, I need some air, I need some air

It's just a love that you can't get back, oh
It's just a tale of a heart attack, oh
You feel alive but you're sinking fast, oh
Just close your eyes, this won't be your last, oh

It's not the prayer you repeat at night, oh
It's not the saint that has seen the light, oh
It's just the breath that you hold inside, oh
Just keep your cool, it will be alright, oh


No more of your eyes
Sharing our fates
In which you find
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

Break in the night
Take them away
Remember why
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

No wonder why
You look away
I give you my
Fear and my pain

I stem the whispers
I kill my cure
You won't stop dead until this world is yours
I dim the speakers
I bang my drum
You won't stop here until the scare is gone

No more of your lies
Endless I wait
Don't close your eyes
It's all in a life, all in a life
Undone, a life alone

No wonder why
You look away
I'll give you my
Fear and my pain

I stem the whispers
I killed my cure
You won't stop dead until this world is yours
I dimmed the speakers
I banged my drum
You won't stop here until the scare is gone

I lost my stake here
I left my crush
You won't find hell until the scare is gone

This feels like
This feels like a curse
This feels like
A dream that's not for love

This feels like
It feels like a curse
This feels like
A dream that's not for love

This feels like
A dream that's not for love
It's not for love
It's not for love


You know you've got a lot to learn
You feel it but your heart won't burn
The fear is runnin' every nerve
Your turning to the ones you've hurt
Nothing ever satisfies
You're screamin' but your tongue's still tied
Starvin' but your love won't feed
Nothin' ever sets you free

You know you've got a long way down
You'll feel it when you hit the ground

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters

Pinned inside the walls of sound
Reachin' but your hands are bound
Cryin' but your love's so sweet
Your singin' but your heart still weeps

And no one ever seems to care
Feels like she walks on air

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters

I can't wait for time to save us
And I can't break your fall forever
'Cause you always take
You always take too much
You always take
You always take too much

It's not what you wanted
It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold
Where nothing matters
It's not what you wanted

It's not what you came here for
This place just leaves you cold, where nothing matters


All along
I've been waiting on
The open invitation
You're silent
Show me no relation

In the rising calm
Don't you feel alone
I'll be standing with your sorrow
All you left me
Is gone away tomorrow
And we may never be here again
And we may never be here again

Pull me up on either side
Don't leave me standing alone in the light
Pull me up on either side
Don't leave me standing alone in the light

All along
I've been waiting on
The open invitation
You're silent
Show me no relation

In the rising calm
Don't you feel alone
I'll be standing with your sorrow
All you left me
Is gone away tomorrow
And we may never be here again
And we may never be here again

I don't ever want to pretend
That maybe this life won't hold you again
I don't ever want to pretend
That maybe this life won't hold you again

(I don't ever want to pretend that maybe this life won't hold you again)
Baby we don't know
Maybe we don't show
But I can't make you understand
And I can't be the better man
So I don't see the summer gone
And I don't feel your heart has sung
And I won't be the one you love
'Cause your whole world has got to start

I don't ever want to pretend
That maybe this life won't hold you again

I don't ever want to pretend

I don't ever want to pretend
(That maybe this life won't hold you again)
Cutting off what I have loved
(I don't ever want to pretend
That maybe this life won't hold you again)
Cuttin' me down with love
Holdin' me off this drug
(I don't ever want to pretend
That maybe this life won't hold you again)
Holdin' me off this drug
Cuttin' us down with love
(Buried inside we're caught...)


Son, I see it in your eyes
There is a burden you cannot hide
But in their arms you feel so alive
And in a moment you're cast aside

All lines have broken
And we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened
But you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten

Now I hear you in my mind
There is a story you bring to life
And I will bow gently by your feet
But tread softly, you tread on my dreams

All lines have broken
And we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened
But you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten

You're crying all these tears
But they mean to leave you dry
You're still fighting all these years
By the same old things we wished we never had

Vision softly fades
But there's a light that still remains
And in these walls I feel your sadness wane
But in the moment you feel no pain

All lines are broken
And we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened
But you've got to go on
I'll comfort you, I'll sing to you
It's a promise not forgotten

Come on baby, let's fight the sunlight
Come on baby, let's light the night


I'm a question of faith
I'm a faded mind
I'm what calls you away
I'm what leaves you in time

I'm a shattered heart
I'm the buried knife
I'm the calling rage
I'm the world at night

I'll give you what you want if you promise you'll keep walking away
I'll give you what you want, keep walking away

Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
Your mind, your mind, your mind
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own

I'm a question of faith
In a shattered mind
I'm what calls you away
To the world on fire

I'll give you what you want if you promise you'll keep walking away

Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
(As you question your own)

Your mind, your mind, your mind
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own

Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own

Your mind, your mind, your mind
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own

Your mind, your mind, your mind
You're never gonna know, your own, your own
What leads you in the nights, just a question of right
As you question your own


Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I fear
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I fear

No more fear, no more fear I'm in love 
Losing sensation for you my love I fear 
Losing sensation for you my love I fear 
No more fear, no more fear I'm in love 

Love, love, I'm in love 

Losing the reasons to breathe I never lived 
I'm losing the reasons to breathe I never lived 
Never lived, never lived I'm in love 

These are my reasons the truth is never filled
These are my reasons the truth is never filled
I'm never filled, never filled I'm in love 

Love, love, I'm in love 

Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill
Red eyes and tears
Red eyes and tears
Red eyes and tears no more for you my love I kill 
No more kill, no more kill I'm in love 

Love, love, I'm in love


Restless sinner, rest in sin,
He's got no face to hold him in.
He feels his day's as dark as night,
He's been waiting with the blind just to find a place to hide his ghost.

No open lies, no consequence,
The door's been closed since he's walked in.
The fight's been raging so many days,
He'll greet you with a cross and a sickle as he helps you in.

You fall in ways to an open fire,
You got no taste for his desire.
He brings you in to warm your bones,
He's the reason why you came, and the reason why you'll have to go.

Mm fool's got a fallen raise,
Another fallen child.

It can't be known what lies and waits,
For those of us in crippled states,
A broken mind is no escape,
When there's no one left to reason with, 
There's no one left to call your name.

Mm fool's got a fallen raise,
Another fallen child.


A part of you is ending 
A part of you holds on 
What leaves your life suspended 
Cradled by the sun 

You found what's right before your eyes 
Speaking like a fool 
You hide yourself inside your words 
Leaving someone else 

But you must leave and not turn back 
Knowing what you hold 
How much time have we got left 
It's killing us, but carries us on 

Carries us all

A part of you is able 
A part of you is gone 
With leads you from the table 
Returning to the cold 

You found yourself inside a tomb 
Screaming to the sun 
You feel your heart can only give 
Pieces of a ghost 

But you must leave and not turn back 
Knowing what you hold 
How much time have we got left 
It's killing us, but carries us on 

Carries us all

I will follow you till we all return 
Till we know our souls survived 
I will follow you till we all return 
Till we know our souls survived 

I will follow you till we all return 
Till we know our souls survived 
I will follow you till we all return 
Till we know you'll carry us on 

Carry us on, carry us all 
Carry us on, carry us all 
Carry us on, carry us all 

Carry us all


Rifles

I see the rifles coming over the hill
And if you shout maybe they stop and won't kill
But if you think like me
You'll be as dead as he

I see the lion crawling over your bed
And if you stay he'll make you walk in your bed
To what you're gonna be
It never lets you be

I see the color in your eyes
I see the images I own
I see more color in your eyes
Than the reflections from purple skies

I won't let you take him away
And I won't give to you the fires of hate
So I will never see
What you've done to me

I see the color in your eyes
I see the images I own
I see more color in your eyes
Than the reflections from purple skies

Now
You come alive
With the world at your side

Now
You come alive
With the world at your side

I see the rifles coming over the hill
And if you shout maybe they stop and won't kill
But if you think like me
You'll be as dead as he
Some day

I see the color in your eyes
I see the images I own
I see more color in your eyes
Than the reflections from purple skies

Now
You come alive
With the world at your side

Now
You come alive
With the world at your side


Please don't suffer 
Gotta just make it quick
You thought you had it 
You don't now what it takes to beg
You lost your cause 
You lost your time to kill
You won't matter much 
When they all got their feel

Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you to rise or fall
Mothers grieve for a son
Fathers teach you 
"You're on your own"

I won't quiver 
I don't squirm a sweat
You lost our gun you got 
Nothing to make a fist
Incinerator  
I'll just flip a switch
Forget we did it 
And you and I will face this hell

Mothers teach to crawl
Fathers teach you to rise or fall
Mothers grief for a son
Fathers teach you to take it on

All my fears awakening
I've let them back
All this flash before my eyes
I never had
Where's your consultation?
Now listen flies 
"Walk my son, I've taught you well
You're on your way down"

Fuck the past I'm up and gone as well 
(You couldn't of lied, your curse is made)
I'm coming fast you got nothing left to say 
(You never saw it, your curse is conscience)
In the end you've got no answers 
(You couldn't of lied, your curse is made)
So much feeling you don't know how to take my hand 
(You never saw it, your curse is conscience)

Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach to you rise or fall
Lessons a pig for a son
Never see what you're reaching for

Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you're on your own
Mothers teach you to take what you waited


I got different debates, my eyes don't survive 
I'm living with the loss and we're livin' in denial 
Good thing you question who's gonna carry on 
There's no one to make then there's no one who can play along 

I need a rival I need a rival 
I'm tired of the fools I'm killin' for survival 
I need a rival i need a rival 
I found my soul and I set it on fire 
I'm nothing like you, I'm not the innocent 
I'm just a sign, it's all gone wrong 

We're nothing like you, we're not the innocent 
We're just a sign, it's all gone wrong 
Well I got the lip, but there's no one available 
I've seen at all before, and firing up a sandstorm 
I go to places no one should ever go 
I'm living like I knew what the hell I was looking for 

I need a rival I need a rival 
I'm tired of the fools I'm killing for survival 
I need a rival I need a rival 
I found my soul and I set it on fire 

My souls on fire I live in superstition, my souls on fire I carry on the fight 
My souls on fire I live in superstition, my souls on fire I carry on the fight 
My souls on fire I live in superstition, my souls on fire I carry on the fight 
My souls on fire I live in superstition, my souls on fire I carry on the fight 

We're nothing like you, we're not the innocent 
We're just a sign, it's all gone wrong 

I'm nothing like you, I'm not the innocent 
I'm just a sign it's all gone wrong 

I need a rival I need a rival 
I'm tired of the fools and killin' for survival 
I need a rival I need a rival 
I found my soul and I set it on fire


Will you lay me down
Will you lay me down
Will you lay me down inside heavens walls
Where every soul is a setting sun

Will you take my hand
Will you take my hand
Will you take my hand down to the waters edge
Where every sin has been washed away

But I can't run if I can't walk
And I won't love if I can't stop
Every minute the pressure drops
From your first breath 'til your heart stops

Will you let them pass
Will you let them pass
Will you let them pass across this killing floor
Where every shadow is cast in stone

But I can't run if I can't walk
And I won't love if I can't stop
Every minute the pressure drops
From your first breath 'til your heart stops

Carry me
Carry me
But you take, take, it's never enough
You just take, take, it's never enough
You just take, take every part of me
All of me


So Jesus left you lonely 
Feels like nothing's really holy 
No one no one hears your calling 
Falling everything is falling 

Do you feel alive? 
Can you feel alive? 
Do you feel alive? 
Can you feel alive? 

So Jesus left you lonely 
Feels like nothings really holy 
No one no one hears your calling 
Falling everything is falling 

Do you feel alive? 
Can you feel alive? 
Do you feel alive? 
Can you feel alive? 

Try so hard just to speak to you 
Nothing ever seems to come through 
Circumstances on the breaking back 
Try to sit down is a therapy 

Oh salvation
Oh salvation

Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?
Do you feel alive?
Can you feel alive?


Well you run from your reasons 
As you slip on your soul 
Now you're keeping a hold of something 
You've never known 
You're tying your mind claiming 
Life is your side, yeah 
You're dyin' alone, 
You should've known it be cold, yeah 
cold yeah cold yeah 
Now you know you're alone, 
You're a screaming gun, yeah 
Gun, yeah, gun, yeah, gun, yeah 

Well you hold down the sign 
And slipping deeper below 
You scream for you purpose 
As you're lettin' it go 
Now all that you hold is 
What's left of your soul 
But what's left of your soul 
You can't keep a hold 
And no soul, yeah, soul, yeah 
Now you know you're alone 
You're a screaming gun 
Yeah, gun, yeah, gun, yeah, gun, yeah 

Well you run from your reasons 
As you slip on your soul 
Now you're keeping a hold of something 
You've never known 
You're tying your mind claiming 
Life is inside, yeah 
You're dyin' alone, 
You should've known it be cold, yeah 
cold yeah cold yeah 
Now you know you're alone, 
You're a screaming gun, yeah 
Gun, yeah, gun, yeah, gun, yeah

I'm mad gonna sell it on a t-shirt
I'm living out a borrowed age
I got God, I got the medication
I got enough make it all go away
Got blood on the mirror boy
Got blood on the empty page
Got blood on the mirror boy
Got blood on the empty page

I got god, I got the imitation
I got the will make it all OK
It's all wrong, wrong intention
I got mine from an empty faith
I'm not proud, too proud of it
I ain't proud, too proud of it
I'm not proud, too proud of it
But I'm fine, just fine with it

It's not enough to carry us over
It's not enough make it all go away
It's not enough to keep me from believing

I'm mad I don't wanna be right
Let it outright take you away

Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you
Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you
One more taste, is all it takes then you bled me gone

I'm death at the lights hesitation, I got a right just to give it away
I got a mean reputation, I got blood on my stolen fate
I got a lairs salvation, I got the dope and the black tar veins

I'm not proud, too proud of it
I ain't proud, too proud of it
I'm not proud, too proud of it
But I'm fine, just fine with it

It's not enough to carry us over
It's not enough make it all go away
It's not enough to keep me from believing
it's not enough make it all OK
I'm mad I don't wanna be right
Let it outright take you away
I'm mad I don't wanna be right
It's not enough make it all OK

Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you
Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you
One more taste is all it takes, then I'm gone

Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you
One more taste then you bled me gone

Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you

Get it, I got it on the run and I'll sell it with you


"I've been here before, 
I know this shade of blue, it's you
I've felt your touch before 
I know your way, 
A ghostlike sense of state, you're gone
So it seems you know me, 
I will wait for you, I do

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die

Slowly I relive a better past a time 
I thought I knew, I blew
Now I'm patient now I know I'll last  
I'll last
I've always known it's true, with you

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die

I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die"


I'm gonna' fade your soul
I'm gonna' bleed your mind
I'm gonna' fade your soul
I'm gonna' bleed your mind
Until your mine
I'm gonna' fade your soul
I'm gonna' bleed your mind
Until your mine
Until your mine
Until your mine

I got your shadow on the run from the violence
I got your shadow on the run from Bigspy's
I got your shadow running the wrong way
I got your shadow on the run (the run x5)
I got your shadow on the run (the run x3)
You better run, run
You better run, run

I'm gonna' fade your soul
I'm gonna' bleed your mind
Until your mine (x3)

(all repeating)
Until your future
Until your mine
Your gonna get it boy
I got your shadow on the run from the violence
I got your shadow on the run


The shadow's creepin', only one way left to go
You hit the bottom where the silence only grows
It's never alone

You feel the fire burnin' sweet within your skin
You're holding on to all the branches crashin' in
It's pulling you in

But you feel the light shine so bright
But you feel the light shine so bright

What is the purpose if you feel so incomplete
What is the reason if it beats you to your knees
What do you keep

Your eyes were wide but there's a world that keeps you blind
A painted serpent turning water into wine
Seekin' light

But you feel the light shine so bright
But you feel the light shine so bright

You're beggin' for the truth but now you've seen too much
You're livin in your head but never feel their touch
And everything was buried by the deep blue sky
Help me to breathe 'cause I don't wanna see the light
Just tell me to breathe 'cause I don't wanna be denied
Just tell me to breathe 'cause I don't wanna be denied

Catch on fire
Catch on fire
Catch on fire
Catch on fire


When everything's going down
And nothing seems to feel the same
no one seems to know my name
no one seems to go my way

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again

One for the soul may dreamers
One for the wicked man
One for the peaceful protests
That keeps the war in demand

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again

Time gonna save our souls
Time gonna save my soul
Time gonna save our souls
Time gonna save my soul

I never thought I'd see it coming
I never thought I'd ever know
Nothing seems to take me over
Nothing seems to let me go

Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again


You've got nothing to say, nothing to say
But you're found a way to make yourself heard
To make yourself heard
These simple words, got nowhere to go

But I'll let you know when they've found a way
When they've found a way
gotta make yourself heard


I kill you all with a 6-barrel shotgun
I kill you all but I need you so
I tear my finger from the trigger baby
I tear my fingers 'cause I'm feeling low and son
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me

You got it bad nothing san save you
Don't look back you gotta a lot of nerve to
Break your word and throw it away
You'd give your soul
But it's just too little too late

I kill myself with a 6-barrel shotgun
I kill you all but I need you so
I tear my finger from the trigger baby
I tear my fingers 'cause I'm feeling low and son
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me

It's in your skin moving too quickly
Shut your eyes or they'll show you no mercy
It's in your love but it don't make it right
It's not my time still I've got to be brave
We've shaken hands and the criminals won
I never liked it but I'm carryin' on
To the end with an empty grin
You come when I say, you come when I say
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me

You lose your tongue
But you know you'll never need it
Hush your head I don't want to remind you
You held my hand when you
Couldn't take the pressure
Save yourself 'cause I need some simulation baby

We've shaken hands and the criminals won
I never liked it but I'm carryin' on
You never liked it till the killin' was done
You come when I say, you come when I say run

I kill you all with a 6-barrel shotgun
I kill you all but I need you so
I tear my finger from the trigger baby
I tear my fingers 'cause I'm feeling low and son
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me
Son Sunday's sun never shone on me

Never shone on me
I never liked it but I'm carryin' on
You never liked it till the killin' was done


Down two crossroads you lay
Sweet lord I'm coming home to stay
Sworn your last turn thrown
Sweet lord I'm comin' home for good
Oh whoa sweet lord I'm comin' home
Oh oh whoa where are ya gonna go

The sweetest souls get there fill
If you tell me the best, know your number chill
Famous name they got paid
Sweet lord it's written on their face
Oh oh whoa where are ya gonna go
Oh oh oh sweet lord come home 

Don't feel like some kind of ghost
Don't feel like some kind of ghost 
Don't feel like some kind of ghost
Don't feel like some kind of ghost


Sometimes the silence is all we know
You leave your picture we fall in love
When lines are memory we carry on
Sometimes the light turns out too bright

I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

Sometimes the fallen is all we know
I leave your picture inside the room
For I'll remember all we could
Sometimes the light turns out too bright 

I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

Sometimes it's falling, I'll love you more 
Sometimes it's falling, I'll love you more 
Sometimes it's falling, on everyone
Sometimes it's falling, on everyone
Sometimes it's falling, on everyone
Sometimes the light turns out to shine
With everyone
With everyone
With everyone
With everyone
With everyone


I need the violence on the radio
I need a murder sound just to let me know
There's no one talking to me, but I'm talking back
And every word's a ghost I keep looking at

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be your last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I'll be the hollow chase of a tragic line
It got the kids in tow just to feed their mind
But sniffing only can pull apart
It takes a dead-end soul to kill a dead-end heart

It's another song
Then it's gone
It's just another song
And then it's gone

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie
I never really can

I'm gonna tell you how it feels
I'm gonna tell you how it was
I'm waiting on a call, yeah
I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the phone but this dead song said
I'm waiting on the call
And I'm waiting on a vision
I'm waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said
Been waiting on the phone, the dead song said
Been waiting on the phone and this dead song said

I'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie
I'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)
Everything a little lie, lie, lie


Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

She gave me love like a big fire 
I only saw it once 
She spread her love like a fever 
She's bad, but not enough 

(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

She spread her love like a big fire 
I only saw it once 
She gave me love like a sister 
She's bad, but not enough 

(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
(I'm so low) 
Spread your love like a fever 
(I'm so low) 
And don't you ever come down 
I spread my love like a fever 
I ain't ever coming down 

Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever 
And don't you ever come down 
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever
Spread your love like a fever


Here she comes, what a pretty gal
Brown shoes on and a sequined gown
I've been waiting on a green light keep me around
She's the type of lover make me
Get and run for cover, when she come around

Here he comes, what a lucky buck
Takes her out in a pickup truck
I've been waiting on the right night, shoot him down
He's the type of mother make you
Kill your only brother as he's waking up

(Oh no)

Hey there mama, can't you hear what I'm saying?
The deed's been done and I can't be waiting
The boy's in a bag in the back of the city dump
When you're sad and lonely, baby
I'll be for you only, in a brand new truck

(And we'll go out, right)


(instrumental)


You're everything you need and so you fight
You take them on your own until you die
The wisdom in your breath comes much too late
And everyone you see just gets a face
In time the words will come, they say, with faith
But everything you see just turns you grey

You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight

No mind or cares, decisions must be made
Whose side whose on, no questions should be saved
Your purpose comes when nothing's left in sight
And it's clear, they sing, that nothing here feels right
Now everyone's afraid 'cause no one moves
Not towards anything worth anything to you

You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight

The righteous come and bleed you from the bone
It's all they ever wanted from your soul
The hating and intentions are no more
And it's all you'll ever get if you let go

You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need, the still suspicion holds you tight


You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but
You don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win you're
Always right behind me
And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a phase
Or will this be around forever 
Don't you know it's going too fast (ooh, to fast)
Racing so heard you know it won't last (ooh, won't last)
Don't you know why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going 
Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do always be together 
Ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba
Ba da ba stay that way forever 
And we know that you can go and find some other
Take or leave it cos we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turnaround 
Don't you know it's going too fast (ooh, to fast)
Racing so heard you know it won't last (ooh, won't last)
Don't you know why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going 
Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
Cos I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time
You need less speed, get off my case
You gotta slow it down baby, just get out of my face 
Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Stop right now thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun 
Stop right now thank you very much
(Stop right now)
I need somebody with a human touch
(We wanna thank, we wanna thank you)
Hey you always on the run
(Stop right now)
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
(Thank you very much, thank you very much)


I am so high
I can't get back
I'm waiting
For what comes next
You can't live
This life for me
But I can't, you have control

I can't last
Tonight turns to day
I can't find
The words to say
It all stops
When kingdom comes

I can't ?
Suddenly
I was free
You left me without anything
Suddenly
I was free
You shot me in front of everything

Now your all I need
Blue shadows behind your eyes
I wonder who you disguise
Through windows behind the sky
I wonder who you will find

I'm so tired
I can't get back
I'm walking to still come back
With something that I have loved
Well I can't, you have control

Suddenly
I was free
You left me without anything
Suddenly
I was free
You shot me in front of everything

Now your all I see
Blue shadows behind your eyes
I wonder who you disguise
Through windows behind the sky
I wonder who you will find


Don't say it's over so soon
We've tied to the day every wrong
We can wait in the shadows of mourning
But to wait just betrays what's to come
There's nothing, there's no one, no cause
And still we believed in it all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone

So they say with a pause
It's just moving on
But I can't see
No I can't see
No I can't see it at all

So they say with a pause
It's just moving on
But I can't see
No I can't see it at all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone

So we say with a pause
We're just moving on
But I can't see
No I can't see
No I can't see it at all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone with you


I gotta feeling I can't lose,
I gotta sympathetic noose,
But I don't know how to be grateful,
Yeah I don't know how you're thankful,
I gotta feeling I can't lose,
I gotta sympathetic noose,
'cause you don't know how to lean on,
Yeah I don't know how to be freed from,
You gotta keep your head up,
You gotta let yourself get through,
All you ever dream,
Makes you want to hide,
Least all your expectations,
Feel the hole inside,
All you ever dream,
It makes you want to hide,
Least all your expectations,
Feel the hole inside.

I gotta feeling in my boots,
I gotta make some sense of you,
'cause I don't know how to be careful,
Yeah I don't know how to be there for,
I gotta feeling I can't prove,
I gotta sympathetic noose,
'cause I don't know how you're grateful,
Yeah I don't know how to be thankful,
You gotta keep your head up,
You gotta let yourself get through,
All you ever dream,
Makes you want to hide,
Least all your expectations,
Feel the hole inside,
All you ever dream,
It makes you want to hide,
Least all your expectations,
Feel the hole inside.


"I keep waiting to see who's gonna say the things I need to know
I keep waiting to see who's gonna say the things I need to know
I keep waiting to see who's gonna say the things am I alone
I keep waiting to see who's gonna say the things am I alone

You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own

You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own
You take them on, on your own"


Surprise, you got a head full of lies 
I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'm a teenage disease, born bred and desire 
I was sold the sun, left out in the night

I'm a coming through, you want it, come and get it 
Don't you say it's a shame, everyone in a rage 
We're going to throw it away, just to live it again 
I'm a total waste, I got the so so grace 
You better grow yourself a smile or get out of the way 
I'm a coming through, you want it, come and get it 

You want it, come and get it 

Surprise, you got a head full of lies 
I'd rather die than be living like you 
I'm a teenage disease, I'm a sun on fire 
I'm gonna make you blind when you fall inside 
You want it, come and get it 
You want it, come and get it 

I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'd rather die, than be living like you 
I'd rather die


Don't it look like rain, mama
Don't it look so cold outside
All the people seem scared and tired
And all the stars seem alight
There's no use in the air, anymore mama
There's no use in their eyes

I just come to say it's over
I just come to say goodbye
I won't compete with the absent
I won't compete for the prize

All them faces are glowing, mama
You can't see what's inside
There's no use for them being anymore
They got the calls in their eyes
It seems a waste to be careless, mama
There's no-one here left to fight

Something - give me something, we're fallin away
Through the minds and the notions we've only depraved
It's a tired imitation that calls your name
It's a cursed invitation that haunts your grave

I just come to say it's over
I just come to say goodbye
I won't compete with the absent
I won't compete for the prize

You twist the knife
And I'll take the bullet
You start the fire
And the world then turns for you

Isn't it right?
Isn't it a crime?
Isn't it cruel to be so kind?
But it's all an act of love and it leaves you blind
And I'm not here to reason or deny
I buried you in a poverty of time

Sometimes there's no other way
You said the things you need to say
At the greatest price
Over a meaningless fight
Didn't it used to be so fine?
Sometimes you need the dark to see the light

You roll the dice
And I play the fool
You turn the tide
But the soul steps through your eyes

Isn't it right?
Or is it just lies?
Isn't it cruel to be so kind?
But some temptations promise you paradise
And I'm not here to listen or confide
And I've paid my debt to a world that bleeds you dry

Sometimes there's no other way
You said the things you need to say
At the greatest price
Over a meaningless fight
Didn't it used to feel so right?
Sometimes you need the dark to see the light


I ain't ever seen the likes of you before
I ain't ever seen the likes of you before

I'll be you ever-loving cure
I'll be you ever-loving cure

I ain't ever gonna let you go baby
I ain't ever gonna let you go darling

You're my ever-loving cure
You're my ever-loving cure

I ain't ever seen the likes of you before
I ain't ever seen the likes of you before


I am the line
I hold you near
There is no burden left to bear
I can't see clear

You're in suspension
You know no love
There is no story left to tell
You have no wisdom to pass on

I am the soul of absolution
No man can hide his own illusion
My hands are crippled from the pain
You are the splinter in my vain

You put your head between your hands
And understand nothing it adds
I feel the answers keep you scared
I've put the harm inside myself.

I am the line
I hold you near
There is no burden left to bear
I can't see clear

I am perfected
I know no void
I have no conscience to keep clear
I understand there's nothing more

You try to kid yourself with questions
Pleading inside for some correction
I found you tied unto the cross
Your judgment owns your every thought

You know my words all mean the same
You're begging to isolate
Into this prison in your mind
Well, you were born without a spine

When did you stop caring?
When did you stop caring?


Your mind is ticking like a bomb
Your center grating in the fog
The pain will keep your senses quick
They crack your soul on the pavement

But all in all you can't disguise it
And all in all it's useless to fight it
The show's about to begin
Let's sit right back and crash it

This is the small roll of the dice
But everyone will have their vice
Senses grind right through their teeth
The madness sets in like concrete

But all in all you can't disguise it
And all in all it's useless to fight it
The show's about to begin
Let's sit right back and crash it

This life is pure fiction
No more reality
Your body's your affliction
Your soul cannot release

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Your mind is gripping in the dark
This broken light pulls us apart
Symphonic blues memories read
Your heart is pulling the last thread

But all in all you can't disguise it
And all in all it's useless to fight it
The show's about to begin
Let's sit right back and crash it


I'd never known her to cry
But this time is different for sure
She's shaking with tears in her eyes
As she picks up what's left of the night
The hope for a reason seemed pure
As we leave what's left on the wall

But oh how it's taken its toll
Oh how it's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll

There was more then a break in the smiles
They rose and slowly they tired
As she turned and the moments were made
There were none that could prove where she lay
There's a calm in the stories now told
And the distance will always be home

And oh how it's taken its toll
Oh how it's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll
Everything's taken its toll

Everything's taken its toll
It's a moment we carry alone
With a cause there's a cure for the soul
But oh how it's taken its toll
Oh how it's taken its toll


Tonight the weight, the weight is more
I will wait no more


(1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

You couldn't doubt her
You couldn't doubt her

Tonight
Tonight's with you
Tonight
Tonight's with you

You couldn't die
You couldn't die

Tonight
Tonight's with you
Tonight
Tonight's with you

It's like a tear falling
It's like a dream always
It's like a dream gone away

Gone away
Gone away
Gone away

You couldn't love her
You shouldn't wonder

Tonight
Tonight's with you
Tonight
Tonight's with you


Don't want to see what all these people see 
They all seem lost with what they've found 
Don't want to hear what all these people hear 
It seems to tell them there's no sound 
Don't want to fight who all these people fight 
It's only truth that's been denied 

Does it feel too real 
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change? 
Does it feel too real 
When everything you love to fear seems the same? 

Don't want to waste away my life savings 
Too many feelings left to save 
No need to talk about the other side 
We learn to live our happy lives 
It's so good, you see just another day 
Learn to savor all the same 

Does it feel too real 
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change? 
Does it feel too real 
When everything you love to fear seems the same? 

Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself? 
Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself? 
Do you turn out the lights so you don't have to see yourself? 

Does it feel too real 
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change? 
Does it feel too real 
When everything you love to fear seems the same? 

Does it feel too real 
When everything you've learnt to love seems to change? 
Does it feel too real 
When everything you love to fear seems the same? 

Does it feel too real?


I took out a loan on my empty heart, babe
I took out a loan for my patient soul
And I feel alive as long as I don't need you
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold

I took out a loan on my empty heart, babe
I took out a loan for my patient soul
And I feel alive as long as I don't need you
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold

Of what I think, I thought I heard you loved me
I think you thought you heard I loved
Have I been mistaken? Have I been mistaken?
I feel confused about the way it's done

I won't be denied, I'm coming in this time, babe
I've fallen in love with your creature's soul
And I've been a witness to your sickest obsession
And I feel alive as long as I keep hold

Of what I think, I thought I heard you loved me
I think you thought you heard I loved
Have I been mistaken? Have I been mistaken?
I feel confused about the way it's done

Have I been mistaken? Have I been mistaken?
I feel confused about the way it's done
Have I been mistaken? Have I been mistaken?
I feel confused about the way it's done


(instrumental)


I stripped my faith on city pavements
To keep a smile
I got my legs from the US government
To keep me alive

We are the ones that keep you down
We are the ones that won the grounds
While our arms surround

I filled my head with another replacement
To keep me high
I shot my soul when you wanted to take this
Your worst day's mine

We are the ones that keep you high
We are the ones that won the sky
With the bird and fly's

She's my river of sunshine
She's my girl
She can save the US
Save the world

She's all right
I'll be fine
These new you whips
Save your mind, come on!

I maybe nothing if you're just gonna waste me
But that's all right
I'll give you love if you want to to taste that
And leave you behind

We are the keep you high
We are the burn your pride
And you're burning in cries

You're gonna make it
You're gonna suffer

I've been waiting for a song to come
Lead me through the gates of Rome
You're gonna know that they were never
Never yours to kill
Oh no, they were never
Never yours to kill

I've been waiting for the song to come
So you all was being done
You're gonna know that they were never
Never yours to kill
Oh no, they were never
Never yours to kill

You're gonna make it
You're gonna suffer


As soon as my vision clears
As soon as these visions leave us
I saw my love as bright as the farthest sea
Every day I'm with you I can almost feel
Soon as I can get my mind around
Soon as I can get my hands around
I'd give you everything but still I'd let you down
Every seconds ending but you'll come around

Come around
Come around
Come around

Maybe we can only wish now
And maybe there's no reason left now
I'm sorry I believed in one way
There's nothing left to take so you go your own

Come around
Come around
Come around 


Nothing seems to lead me to these words 
I need to tell you, tell you more
Everything's been tainted that I told you, 
That I told you once before
Something hides the meaning 
There's no meaning in the words I said before
There's no meaning in the things 
I've told you long before

I've been waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what 
I've been here waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what
I've been waiting here

Something leaves me in these words I tell you, 
In these words I tell you more
Everything I've said is true 
I've told you the truth as I told before
These are all I meant to say they're all 
I've meant to tell you long before
There's no meaning in the things 
I've told you long before

I've been waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what 
I've been here waiting here to see what 
I've been waiting here

There's no meaning in the things 
I've told you long before

I've been waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what 
I've been here waiting here to see what
I've been here waiting here to see what
I've been waiting here.


You just turned so white
Never needed you so bad
There's nothing left to disguise
You never wanted it so bad
You don't need your soul
They'll keep you high
I keep chasing your ghost
But it all keeps us comin' back for a little while

You don't look so good
But you smell like you would
You don't seem so proud
In the cries and thunder
And now the ones you beg
They won't kiss it away
I just need your hand
When it all keeps comin' down for a little while

Yeah I called my friend the doctor just to keep your heart alive
He said I ain't too good at healing but I'll make you stand
I need just one more line
I need you to stand
And it all keeps comin' out into the light

You never seemed so cruel
It's just a question of time
We used a war machine
Now it burns out your spine
You don't prove your worth
You just make it obscene
Yeah it ain't no crime to blow your mind
If it feels to you like a never ending dream


Your hands are coarse, your skin so pale
The body aches, but your soul will not fail
Don't resist your welcome tongue
The heart is thick but so worn you can't talk

Light a way just to lead the past
Extend between the shelter with you
The time it will take just to show that 
There's nothing more to take from me ahhhh

**Musical interlude

Nowhere we sow will flee from your kiss
The mind keeps its count so it's measured in bliss
Don't let him work towards the heart
The war you wage, the further we part

Break from your sage just you know that
I still remain and shelter you
Time stands too still just you feel the crack
and curse your love, your Warning Sign ahhhh

In time you will take
Love your fate
Touch still remains
Keeps you whole

Your foolish gift your wounded love
I gave it all, still your song was unsung
Work through this can't temptations cost
The more you gave just rips your soul's light apart

To wake from this sleep just you hear what it means
You spoke to me, I'll sing to you
Time stands too late just to feel your reach
and lift you mind your Warning Sign ahhhh


I'll keep it in my head till I know I
Until I know that I can leave your doorstep
Until I know the conversations cold
I'll hide it in the words until I know I
Until I know that I can be alone here
Until I know the consequences known

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'll throw you out and bring you back later
Everything I see's a complication
Everyone I known has come and go
I've fallen in the reason for the passion
Everyone needs something for their hands when
When they know they're gonna be alone

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
I'm looking for something to shout
Something I know I cannot doubt
Come on won't help me out

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I'm in love without you
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you 
I'm in love without you

We're all in love with something that we can't see
We're all in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with something that we can't see
I'm in love with someone that we can't see

I've got a streak, and you want to loosen up 
But there's no time to feast your eyes 
You want it all, but the world won't give it up 
Up to the edge, a star will rise 

What is your weapon of choice 
What's your weapon of choice 
Where is the weapon to free us all us? 
What is your weapon of choice 
What's your weapon of choice 
Where is the weapon to free us all? 

I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 
I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 

Everyones got their own spent factions 
Every bomb will pay its price 
I've been digging in the wrong directions 
Lets see you threaten the afterlife 

What is your weapon of choice 
What's your weapon of choice 
There is the weapon to free us all us 
What is your weapon of choice 
What's your weapon of choice 
There is a weapon to free us all 

I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 
I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 

It's too hard to stand aside 
Here's the love to stop your heart 

I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 
I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 
I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation 
I won't waste it, I won't waste it, I won't waste my love on a nation


This is more than I wanted,
Take me out of the dark, I roam there,
Cold and black, you're out of touch, yeah,
Lightly falling through a whisper, you're scared.

It's the weight of the world, I know, as I'm struggling to be.
It's the weight of the world, I know, as you were mine, and we will find

This is stranger than love for us,
Turning backwards to face the demon,
No excuse for a wasted life,
Lightly falling through a whisper of sky.

It's the weight of the world, I know, as I'm struggling to be.
It's the weight of the world, I know, as you were mine, and we will find

Time will change, still the world remains the same,
Time will change, still the world remains the same.

It's the weight of the world, I know, as I'm struggling to be.
It's the weight of the world, I know, as you were mine, and we will find


1, 2, 3, 4!

You want a part of me
You want the whole thing
You want to feel something more than I could ever bring
You want it badly
You want it tangled
I want to feel something more than I was strangled

I fell in love with the sweet sensation
I gave my heart to a simple chord
I gave my soul to a new religion
Whatever happened to you?
Whatever happened to our rock 'n roll?
Whatever happened to my rock 'n roll?

She wants it hallow
She wants it tainted
She wants to feel something more than she was naked
You want to hide away
You scared you'll touch it
I want to feel something more than I can ever take

I fell in love with the sweet sensation
I gave my heart to a simple chord
I gave my soul to a new religion
Whatever happened to you, rock'nroll?
Whatever happened to our rock 'n roll?
Whatever happened to my rock 'n roll?

You know you never decide.
Why you can't trust their lies.
It's so much pain you can't describe.
There's got to be another reason for living.

She wants your image
She wants your kiss
She wants to get inside your head and tell it like it is
You want it badly
You want it so completely
I want to feel something more cos I can't fuckin' breathe

I fell in love with the sweet sensation
I gave my heart to a simple chord
I gave my soul to a new religion (rock 'n roll)
Whatever happened to you, rock 'n roll?
Whatever happened to our rock 'n roll?
Whatever happened to my rock 'n roll?


I'm ready for you
All ready for you
Come and get me, darling
You know I'm gonna getcha, darlin'

(Spoken)
He kept climbing
And as it turned to dusk below him
Soon there was no turning back
So he went on and in this climb it seemed, that felt as a walk 
He didn't tire or ache or see no limit 
And it only broadened twice what it was 
He passed known, and looked down no more 
He saw night ahead and reached for it 
As he stumbled forward, it pulled away 
And he realized a choice 
A bitter cold arose from inside 
And soon he couldn't speak 
Although he had no "need" 
He had great want and could not
His mouth frozen from grief 
He saw his breath climb out eager to carry on without him 
He knew he'd have to wait and he knew what for


All ready for you 
I'm ready for you
Come and get me, darling
You know I'm gonna getcha, darlin'

I'm ready for you
All ready for you


Jesus, when you coming back 
Jesus never coming back

Jesus seemed to steal my soul 
He'll never let me go 
Jesus gonna make me pay

I want to go home 

Jesus when you go will you come back 
Jesus when you go will you come back 
Jesus I dare you to come back

I'm the kinda guy who leaves the scene of the crime 

I wouldn't come back if I'd have been Jesus

Turn your eyes from the window
So you won't see this world
The walls are closing inward
There's nowhere left to turn

You want it, you need it, the words slip away
You're crying your eyes out, your mind wants to break
Your heart is your weakness, your song plays endlessly
Wonder how you sleep

All your houses crumble
Shadows begin to howl
There's spiders on the rooftops
The trapdoor is in ourselves

You want it, you need it, the words slip away
You're crying your eyes out, your mind wants to break
Your heart is your weakness, your song plays endlessly
Wonder how you sleep, it's a wonder to me

So how's it going to feel when you don't know what's real
You tell yourself it's love, then tear your insides up
So how's it going to feel when you don't know what's real
You tell yourself it's love, then tear yourself apart

Senses, all been fractured
The traitor's in your sights
The hour's spinning backwards
There's nowhere left to hide

You want it, you need it, the words slip away
You're crying your eyes out, your mind wants to break
Your heart is your weakness, your song plays endlessly
Wonder how you sleep, it's a wonder to me

So how's it going to feel when you don't know what's real'
You tell yourself it's love, then tear your insides up
So how's it going to feel when you don't know what's real'
You tell yourself it's love, then tear yourself apart

How many people must learn' 
How many roads must you turn'
There's something hiding below
How many tears must you cry' 
How many buried inside
Until you finally let go'

How many years must you fight' 
How many stories survive
Until the tables will turn'
How many days must you brave' 
How many years must you pay'
There's nothing left to let go


I've been down the wishing well
I feel I've lost my touch
I'm losing all the time
I've known it all along

Well it feels alright
Yeah it feels okay
I'm gettin' on my shirt
And I'm goin' on my way

(Yeah)

Feels insane
We'll be sorry when its gone
But it takes no time
And I'm sorry I stayed so long

Well, it feels alright
Yeah, it feels okay
We're getting all our shirts
And we're goin' on our way

We're lucky that we ever had a chance
We're never gonna see it again
We've been waiting on the edge of fallin'
Staring while we drown
In promised lands our proud retreat
Our lives, our needs, our bounds

Well it feels alright
Yeah it feels okay
We're gettin' all our shirts, and we're goin' out
Well it feels alright
Yeah it feels okay
We're gettin' all our shirts, and we're goin' out
Well it feels alright
Yeah it feels okay
We're getting all our shirts, and we're goin' on our way


Woah broken salvation complete devastation
Woah the blood on your hands (to) satisfy your fixation
Now you live with weight of regret crushing your chest
You will never forget the life that you take
Forever you pay for your mistake
Oh the hearts that you break
You took someone's mother, you took someone's father
You took someone's son. You took someone's daughter
Now dwell as you burn in your own personal hell
Woah broken salvation complete devastation
Woah the blood on your hands (to) satisfy your fixation
Mother, this eats me
It's so hard to reject the hate that this feeds me father
Do you remember when your life changed forever?
The day the life with your father was severed?
Someone took someone dear to you someone dear to me
Someone who i'll never have the chance to meet
And all I can be is angry
Your selfishness astounds me
A horror that feeds off warmth surrounds me
I'm drowning i'm drowning
This has made a mess of me and frankly I have no more energy
So all i'll be is angry


ONG TWO THREE GO!

Its one thing 
to turn your back on everything 
you believe 
but now you've turned your back on me 
what happened to you 
what happened to you
what happened to you

and I may not 
wear my heart on my shirt 
on my hand as a badge as a brand 
but that doesn't mean 
this isn't sticking with me 

COME ON!

This is sticking with me
This is sticking with me

lets take this back to the beginning  

who stood by who 
who helped you up 
when you fell through 
I'm not looking for recognition 
I just want you 
to understand my position 
I don't agree with your decisions 
I've seen you conquer so much more  but I'm still here 
and that wont change 
my heart remains the same 

and I may not 
wear my heart on my shirt 
on my hand as a badge as a brand 
but that doesn't mean 
this isn't sticking with me 

COME ON!

This is sticking with me
This is sticking with me

BRING IT BACK DOWN

bring it back down

you turned your back on me 
you turned your back on me
you turned your back on me 
you turned your back on me 

and 
and everything you believe
you turned your back on me

and 
and everything you believe
you turned your back on me  



A poor mans poor sport we've fallen short of reasoning
sex does not determine capability
but we let our hostility be our guide to decide what's right for a girl and for a guy
because every sex is just as able to keep this foundation stable
enough is enough speak up its tough but don't think that your unable
let acceptance be our key to unlock our integrity
from there we'll be able to see that there's more than just she and he
no longer constrained by insecurity chauvinism aside we'll let acceptance be our guide
once this is done progression will come.. 
time and time again we take a step back from where we began
I cannot stress this enough cannot run this course without you
like its been said before two heads are better than one
no apology just equality it takes a fool to see that a girl isn't equal in the world.. never again
there minds constrained voices retained our hearts beat the same they've been here just as long and they're just as strong
just as long
still going strong
overcome
I can only hope that you'll overcome
stand up be strong 


So saddening, all their minds know is pain.
Such apathy, we've thrown their suffering away.
Diminishing, their world falls apart right before their eyes.
Such cruelty, we sit and watch as they die from the inside.

How can we see such human suffering
And just turn the other way?
A tragedy when a child can be thrown away
as easily as an accessory.

What about the voiceless?
The choiceless?
They're the unseen, they don't have the means.
We have a responsibility.
It's up to us.

ACCESSORY CHILDREN!
ACCESSORY CHILDREN!

We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We have a responsibility!
We (WE!) have a responsibility!
We (WE!) have a responsibility!
We (WE!) have a responsibility!
We (WE!) have a responsibility!


I know you, because you're just like me
Always questioning every single thing
Never giving up without a fight
Because for you, your resistance is a way of life
Young and angry, with every right to be
Bent but not broken, hanging on by a thread
Looked past by most, looked down on by all
We don't need them, it's forever us against them all
A fire burns inside you, fueled by everything that
You've ever been through
Every battle you fight goes uphill
But nothing can ever break your iron will
Young and angry, with every right to be
Bent but not broken, hanging on by a thread
Looked past by most, looked down on by all
We don't need them, it's forever us against them all
We don't need them


My kindness 
has been mis-
taken for 
a weakness 
disrespect  
carelessness 
is result  
selfishness!

disrespect 
carelessness is 
result of 
your 
selfishness

LETS GO!

I stood 
right by your side 
and gave you 
all of my time
and in return you 
took all my pride 
so I'm here to 
take back what's mine

and your friendship I still keep 
but honestly 
how far must you go 
to an all time low

This song goes out to
Everyone who has been taken advantage of.
And to thoes who are taken advantage of, stay true to what you love

I see 
right through your disguise 
I see the lies you hide behind 
and this cant stop until you realize 
a thing or two 
about sacrifice

SACRIFICE

what's done is 
done and its 
time to move 
on so lets 
forgive and 
lets forget 
put back in-
to the past



Her name is amber
She has eyes like her mother
She's beautiful and bright the whole worlds in front of her
She has a smile that could end a war
Yet no one wants her and she has nothing to care for
She's only 14 and she thinks
Why is the weight of the world crashing down on me
'Cause as of late the sun doesn't seem to shine so bright
And the place where my heart once was has lost its fight

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

You don't have to be alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

Her arms are locked in the devil's chains
And her heart, broken and trapped in a steel cage
She can't catch her breath as she chokes on the pain
So she brings her pain to the surface of her skin

Your frozen agony burns you 
Can't even begin to know the nightmare that you've been through
Only you can break the cycle that plagues you
There is a light you just have to see it through

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
But braves her storm
You are not alone


1, 2, 3, 4
Go!

It's one thing to turn your back on everything you believe
But now you've turned your back on me
What happened to you?
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

And I may not wear my heart on my shirt
On my hand, as a badge, as a brand
But that doesn't mean
This isn't sticking with me
Come on
This is sticking with me
This is sticking with me

Let's take this back to the beginning
Who stood by who?
Who helped you up when you fell through?
I'm not looking for recognition
I just want you to understand my position

I don't agree with your decisions
'Cause I've seen you conquer so much more
But I'm still here and that won't change
My heart remains the same

And I may not wear my heart on my shirt
On my hand, as a badge, as a brand
But that doesn't mean
This isn't sticking with me
Come on
This is sticking with me
This is sticking with me

Bring it back down
Bring it back down

You turned your back on me
You turned your back on me
You turned your back on me
You turned your back on me
And everything you believe
You turned your back on me
And everything you believe


The fire burns
Our faces warm from its heat
Nights like these, they make me think
About the person I once was
And the person I'll become

My mind turns
And steps its weight upon my throat
Desperate for breath while watching me choke
If this is the end
You can bet your ass, I won't go out like them

These feelings, they keep pulling at me
And they won't let go
Until I face the fact, until I reap what I sow
Their voices, they keep calling you
They keep calling at you
Until they make you believe that there's nowhere to go
They'll do everything they can to drag you under
But you know the truth
So don't let these motherfuckers come at you

Most times the things to which we cling
Aren't the same things that we need

We sit and watch our dance of death
As we slowly drown in this selfishness
This is the end, you're one of us
I can't go out like them, better ash than dust
Better ash than dust

These choices, they keep following you
But you can't back down
Yeah, they got to believe that there's no way out
Our voices, the last thing they'll hear
As they smash down upon us
What will continue is what we allow

Most times the things to which we cling
Aren't the same things that we need
And sometimes the things we love
Are the things we need to leave

We sit and watch our dance of death
As we slowly drown in this selfishness
And this is the end, you're one of us
I can't go out like them, better ash than dust
Better ash than dust
Better ash than dust

Better ash than dust

"I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don't think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That's why they're so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don't think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and not reflect the times?"


She thinks, "Another day I'm left to drag my broken soul through the streets
Into work and school, then back home"
Not a man in her life that makes her feel whole
Because it's the men in her life that filled her with those holes
"What have I done to deserve this?"
To face a raising first that screams
"You think I like this bitch?!"
Don't you worry my darling, mommy just tripped
She can feel her sanity starting to slip
So she dreams, if I could just go
Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me
Entangled in a web of complete misery
Her cries are stifled by a fear of what he might do to the kids
"If I just stick it out this might end soon"
"This is all my fault"
If I had just done what he said I could have avoided this all"
And still she dreams, if I could just go
Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me
How can we let this be?
Our sister and mothers are dying
How can we let this be?
Our mothers are dying
How can we let this be?


The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
Chewed up and spit out, lost and alone
Your jobs been ripped from you and on deck, your home
Can't feed yourself, let alone feed the kids
American dreams have turned to your American greed
Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets
On the priority list we place dead last
And their foreclosed signs line our 'greener grass'
Look me in my eyes you crooked fuck
Not one more god damn lie
Your time is up
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
Watch the weight of it all come crashing down
United, now the kings will lose their crown
Now we're shit out of luck and they don't give a fuck
No they don't give a fuck
Now the masses awaken
The embodiment of sacrifice
History in the making
Witness defining moments of our lives
Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets
On the priority list we place dead last
And their foreclosed signs line our 'greener grass'
Look me in my eyes you crooked fuck
Not one more god damn lie
Your time is up
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
Watch the weight of it all come crashing down
United, now the kings will lose their crown
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down


Day in and day out
Shit on and kicked in
The world's garbage you lift sifting
Mind like a wrath flame and flood
Dine talking, no one's listening
They pushed me, the pushed me
I'll rip this place at the seams
They did this, not me
Inflicted with this disease
I'm screaming, god help me
I scream as loud as I can
This is another life
Built upon the sand
You've hit bottom and you're still sinking
So small and you're still shrinking
What can you do
You've gone from alone to completely see through
Let's all watch while the hammer falls
They pushed me, they pushed me
I'll rip this place at the seams
They did this, not me
Inflicted with this disease
I'm screaming, God help me
I scream as loud as I can 
This is another life
Built upon the sand
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you 
I understand
I understand you
I understand
I understand you
I understand
I understand you
I understand
I understand You


History repeats itself again
when will this all end
and when will we begin
i guess until you have no one left to offend
why must we be left alone
well never make it on our own
one mind one heart one soul to find another way for us to see eye to eye
when will understand we let ourselves down again
and the time it takes for us to hate is the time it takes for this to end
why cant we set aside these differences placed in our minds why cant we close our eyes and live our lives colorblind
look at the mess we've made
we let our selves be ruined by our hate
its never to late to change
look at the ruins we create
one another we underestimate
and its never to late to change
what do we need to do to live in sanctuary is this all really necessary
to discriminate based on race our steps we must retrace
and put ourselves in each others place
our hearts have been misplaced 


Compassion 
without compromise  
our weak actions cant be justified  
one another's perspectives 
we have denied  

but I know what's meant for me  
and we may not all agree  
I just hope 
somewhere in the middle 
we can meet  

but for now 
its time to swallow your pride 
because we wont all comply  
(and youll be here to wipe us out)?
but I wont turn my back on you
instead of living in self denial 
we're being victims of false approval  we must learn to 
find acceptance within our selves 
learn to put our hearts on trial  
learn to put our hearts on trial

TWO THREE FOUR

and we are all here together 
side by side with one another  
we all bleed 
we all cry 
we must learn to confide 
within each other
we must learn to confide 
within each other

we all bleed the same 
way we all have our own say  
and if we want things to change 
we must stand 
and endure our own hate  
what I believe is the only thing 
that separates you from me  
but it shouldn't affect the way we think and treat each other

and if we want things to change

UNER THE SUN(4x)


I am a brave man, I am a coward
I am the tiger, I am the flower
I am honest, and I'm a liar
I am vital, I am tired
I am a free man, I am caught
From where I am, I see the top
I am, most importantly never concerned with what I am not

(I am) A brave man, a coward
The tiger, the flower
(I am) Honest, a liar
I am vital and so fucking tired
(I am) A free man, I am caught
From where I am, I see the top
(I am) Most importantly never concerned with what I am not

(I am) Forever more than just surviving
This is my life and this life is my diamond


I know that what's in front of me is a reflection of what is inside of me
I see that 
I need to be myself because it's so lonely in the eyes of someone else 
I feel  
Oh I feel 
Ya I feel and I always will 
I starve to leave fee from fear 
To free myself, before I disappear 
I am forever more than just surviving 
This is my life and this life is my diamond 
My time
Your time
Our time is running out


The world is you
You are the world, there is no other thing
If we accept that, if we see that, not intellectually
But feel it in your heart, in your mind
In your blood that you are that, then the question
Is it possible for a human being to transform himself
Inwardly and therefore outwardly?


So here we go again. 
Ignorance brought back 
by popular demand. 
It seems that I'll never understand. How much more 
must we lose 
before we turn this and around 
and choose 
do we dress the part 
or do we have the heart? 

WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
You'll knock us down 
we'll get back up. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
We'll tear this down 
we'll push our luck. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
From here on out 
this is for us. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
We'll cross everyline 
you draw in the sand 
we'll always have the upperhand. 

This time around 
we're fighting for something. 
This time around its all or nothing. 


WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
You'll knock us down 
we'll get back up. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
We'll tear this down 
we'll push our luck. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 

No more excuses.
We're gunna follow this 
through to the very end. 
No more excuses. 
We won't let them take this again. TAKE US AGAIN!

You'll knock us down 
we'll get back up.
We'll tear this down 
we'll push our LUCK!

WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
You'll knock us down 
we'll get back up. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
We'll tear this down 
we'll push our luck. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
From here on out 
this is for us. 
WE ARE THE DRIVING FORCE. 
We'll cross everyline 
you draw in the sand 
we'll always have the upperhand. 
we'll always have the upperhand. 


For the most part I think I've got you figured out
You walk around like you know what this is all about
Will one of you idiots please just say something new?
Ya, well you say, "fuck the world" 
We say, "fuck you"

But you've been nowhere and you've seen nothing
It's your stupid stare, it tells me everything
If you can't beat them try harder because we're not going down
You better give back or get out

Get back or get out

For the most part I know what you're so mad about
We don't belong, never did, and you want us out
You've become such a slave to your own mouth
You better give back or get out

Get back or get out

Same game
You're doing nothing new
All the same
You think no ones laughing at you?
I've always stood behind every word I've ever said
All talk, no walk
Empty words from empty heads


I'm broken, from every word we left unspoken.
Lost focus, left to feel hopeless.
One life (ONE LIFE!)
One time (ONE TIME!)
Let's make things right.
One life (ONE LIFE!)
One time (ONE TIME!)
Let's make things right.
LET'S MAKE THINGS RIGHT!

Enough's enough.
Why have we given up?
Lost track of everything we love.
Look's like the jokes on us.
This is all that we know,
And we've worked way too hard just to let this go.

And you were the one 
That taught me that giving up 
Was never an option!

You were the one that taught me that giving up was never an option.
I'll be there when you cash your sins in,
And all your opinions have fallen.

I'm broken, from every word we left unspoken.
Lost focus, left to feel hopeless.
One life, one time
Let's make things right.
One life, one time
Let's make things right,
LET'S MAKE THINGS RIGHT!
LET'S MAKE THINGS RIGHT!
LET'S MAKE THINGS RIGHT!
LET'S MAKE THINGS RIGHT!

Enough's enough.
Why have we given up?
Lost track of everything we love.
Looks like the joke's on us.
This is all that we know,
And we've worked way to hard just to let this go.

Enough's enough.
Why have we given up?
Lost track of everything we love.
Looks like the joke's on us.
This is all that we know,
And we've worked way to hard just to let this go.

Enough's enough. 
I refuse to give this up.
Lose track of everything I love.
Looks like the joke's on us.
This is all that we know.
We've worked way to hard just to let this go.

Enough's enough.
I refuse to give this up.
Lose track of everything I love.
Looks like the joke's on us.
And now it's up to us to pick this up.

It's no matter what you hear
Foes are rocking over there
Fought away the dribbleness
Believe it!
Shut your trap! (Every day)
Pursuing! (Every day!)
Every second! (Every day!)
From now to eternity
Shut your trap! (Every day)
Pursuing! (Every day!)
Every second! (Every day!)
From now to eternity
Break your leg and dim my eyes
Or you've felt you'll be okay
Opened by unopen hearts
Educate
The question we must guess
We shoot again and again
It's the way I wanna change
The struggle through this pain
I was born a god, I was born a mess
Smashed the suffering anyway that I can!
The question we must guess
We shoot again and again
It's the way I wanna change
The struggle through this pain
I was born a god, I was born a mess
Smashed the suffering anyway that I can!
I believe we can change
I believe we can change
I believe we can change
Anything, anything


From the soul of the unnamed,
To the devastating depths of the heads and the hearts of the shamed
With patience like the fury of a freight train
I'll always have faith in the untamed
I have faith in the untamed
No room to think when digression is fought
Progression of thought dies and goes right out the door
It's hard to move on when tradition is the whore
That keeps your feet nailed to the frozen floor
Now it weighs down your mind
Once again left you deaf, dumb, and blind
But I have faith that one day
We'll have the strength to rip out every single page
I have faith you'll find no peace from this
You'll still be empty
It will never end
This tradition is downfall
It's hard to let go when you're still holding on
You'll find no peace from this
You'll still be empty
You better believe we're breaking boundaries
A routine for the uninspired
For the hearts that lack any fire
You put your thoughts in dying hands
While you wade through the quicksand.


What's with all the starring 
why are you so worried about 
what they're wearing
you care more 
about their hair 
then understanding

that you are the real critic here 
so take a look into the mirror
don't waste your breath 
give it a rest 
this isn't a contest 
you make us all 
second best

SECOND 
BEST!

I'm sorry I can't help but laugh 
you've fallen into the trap 
of thinking what we wear 
determines who we are 
you've taken this way too far

when will you realize 
what matters is what's on the inside 
so you and I must cast aside 
this pointless fight to 
keep alive our able minds



to stand on my two feet
to lock these trembling knees
this is what we need to not 
fall in the defeat

FALL IN THE DEFEAT!

they cant break me down

and I am sick and tired of fighting fire with fire
we've been misplaced 
we've been defaced 
but our heart will never be erased

FIRE WITH FIRE

we've been misused 
we've been defused 
but this fight we will not lose
and I 
will resist 
to ever make a fist

resistance 
marked as a weakness
ignorance 
masked as intelligence

I stand in defiance

I stand in defiance

our violence has left 
us with a head made of stone 
and a heart just as cold
a youth overdosing on animosity 
and loathing 
has made us close the gates 
and create a beast
a being like no one has ever seen
we have made ourselves 
mere men among giants
may you stand with me in defiance
may our only defense 
be letting down our defense
let defenseless 
left free of all our fences

no longer will hostility guide us
and no longer will hate divide us
no longer will violence undermine us

no longer will hostility guide us
and no longer will hate divide us
no longer will violence undermine us

FIRE WITH FIRE

we've been misused 
we've been defused 
but this fight we will not lose
will not lose
will not lose


The more I live my life 
the more I start to see it 
from a new light
The more I see 
this disease 
transfer from you to me

But I can't see 
why we need to create and make all this hate 
because this place wasn't shaped 
for us to bruise and break

This is for the kids who wont quit 
and continue to lay the bricks
And add to this creation 
and don't 
shake its foundation

For the ones who still 
have their self respect
For the ones who break their neck 
to hold us up
For those who wont 
for ones who give us hope

For the ones who put their heart 
in from the start
We're all brothers, we should be here for each other
This our home this is a place 
for us to feel safe 
this 
can't be replaced

This is for the kids who wont quit 
and continue to lay the bricks
And add to this creation 
and don't 
shake its foundation

For the ones who still 
have their self respect
For the ones who break their neck 
to hold us up
For those who wont 
for ones who give us hope

For the ones who put their heart 
in from the start
We're all brothers, we should be here for each other
This our home this is a place 
for us to feel safe 
this 
can't be replaced

For the kids 
BY THE KIDS

For the kids
BY 
THE
KIDS

for the kids
BY
THE 
KIDS



he best has yet to come
all damage has been done and we have just begun to see what we've become
and I cant help but see a need to turn this all around
and lift ourselves up from the ground
because for what its worth we can not go unsound 
and for far to long we've we been fighting more than singing along
let a new dawn arise let open our eyes 
to something new a new born youth an untold truth there's no excuse for us use to explain out self abuse
we have so much more to give
we are the alternative and our voices will rise in unison
we have yet to begin and we cant let ourselves wear thin and for what its worth our resolve will not see its end


Frustration overwhelms me. nothing left but this empty feeling. rejection from the very same thing that gave me definition. so i'll bite the hand that feeds me, fight the hand that bleeds me, break the hand that cheats me me. you will never defeat me. i would rather stand and fight without a chance at all than wait around for these 'so called' friends to break my fall. you pass your judgement on me when it's you whose buckling at the knees. we'll bite the hand that feeds us, feeds us. we'll fight the hand that bleeds us, bleeds us. we'll break the hand that cheats us, cheats us. you'll never defeat us. we are stronger and we fight harder than any makeshift martyr. such an arrogant elite, just begging to be heard. you scream word after hollow word but now it's our turn. i've been there too. alone in a crowded room and they're all laughing at you. a room full of rolling eyes and self doubt. narrow minds and big mouths. you're not in this alone and you don't have to feel that you are. we're what separates the heart from the heartless, so we'll push forward regard less of the consequence. we're what separates the heart from the heartless, so we'll keep pushing regardless


Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you
Enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do
What to think, and what to feel?!
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.
I see the way you all suffer the same
Try to tell me there' no other way
I hate how you shove this in my face
Day after day after fucking day
Fuck the way you try to turn my world
Black and white
I won't let you bleed the color from my life
I choose nothing
I choose no one
I'd rather lose than ever be like you!
There's always a way
Nothing, no one
I refuse to hold your smoking gun.
I'd rather lose than ever be like you
There's always a way, always a way, always a way!
I don't live my life by your made-up rules
I can't identify with your twisted views
No one dictates my life for me
Don't even try!
You will never understand me
Don't waste your time
(Waste your time!)
I choose nothing
I choose no one
I'd rather lose than ever be like you!
There's always a way
Nothing, no one


What do I have to do to get through to you? 
I've sat and waited patiently, and its so plain to see that you no longer have any faith in me. 
So what happens when we're all gone and you have no one left to put the blame on? 

NOT AGAIN! 
NOT TODAY! 
FROM UNTIL THE END WE DO THINGS OUR WAY! 
NOT AGAIN! 
NOT TODAY! 
FROM HERE UNTIL THE END WE DO THINGS OUR WAY! 

We've been underestimated, 
left to fix the mess you created, (and its taken it's toll. )
You put us down just to build you up, now you're falling apart and you're looking to us,

this game is getting old. 
We are the truth, 
we are the youth, 
this time you lose
because we make the rules. 
WE MAKE THE RULES! 

I'm not sure how much more I can take and I'm not sure how much longer I can fake that this makes sense to me. 
You make it look so easy, 
but I can promise you that WE'VE GOT MORE HEART THAN YOU! If you would just give us a chance to prove WHAT WE CAN DO! 

We've been underestimated, 
left to fix the mess you created, (and its taken it's toll. )
You put us down just to build you up, now you're falling apart and you're looking to us,

this game is getting old..
this game is getting old..

We'll them away with the impact we'll make. 
We'll blow them away... with the impact we'll make. 
WE'LL BLOW THEM AWAY WITH THE IMPACT WE'LL MAKE! 
WE'LL BLOW THEM AWAY with the impact!



This is an industry 
of infamy 
I refuse to believe that 
you do for the passion 
you let your mind and heart be rationed

music is my life 
its something that 
cant be priced
you lead with your greed 
and you want me to believe 
you take this seriously
but I think that you take back all that's been given out of creativity
I put everything I have into this 
and to me brilliance still exists

This is an industry 
of infamy 
I refuse to believe that 
you do for the passion 
you let your mind and heart be rationed

you focus on a dollar sign 
rather than a creative mind 
you want a mind that can be sold 
mine wont be controlled 
I wont let you take 
what this has given to me
what this has given to me
what this has given to me

What its given to me

A purpose and a drive 
something I cant hide 
something worth doing 
in a positive light 
I wont fit your stereotype
you work in a business of deceiving 
but my words 
my heart 
my life 
have a meaning and music for 
a constructive youth 
is something worth achieving

but this time I wont let 
your lack of sincerity 
get a hold of me
this is where you end

You end where we begin
YOU END WHERE WE BEGIN
You end where we begin


I would never make a song that everybody agreed with, 'cause... how do you do that, you know? You do that by making songs that don't say anything, and if no one's challenged in any way possible, there's now way you can be misinterpreted and there's no way anyone could build up enough emotions to... react.


Take a step back!
How can this be?
So much begging pleadin' with no on listenin'
Take a breath now and think of what this really means!
This is my understandin'!
That the life I lead does not belong to me!
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
It starts with me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
In a world where doing what's right
Has been pushed from the light
And forced underground
Into back alleys, and places abandoned
What choice do we have?
Tell me! What choice do we have?
What choice do I have?!
What choice do I have?!
But to force my own hand!
Each human being, it doesn't matter whether he's a politician, or a business man or a
Just and ordinary person like me, in the street
We should all be, as a human being to realize the enormous
Suffering, misery, confusion there is in the world
And it's our responsibility to change all that.

Bottled up, broken down, day after endless day
Falsified for the chance just to stay alive
They look to words just for love and protection but
We just throw them away

Tell me
With everything you see
Am I wrong?

Tell me
With everything you see
Am I wrong?

Misunderstood, just like me
Forever's coming, this is agony
How can we call ourselves humane with a straight face
While we just throw them away?

Tell me
With everything you see
Am I wrong?

Am I wrong?

Misunderstood, just like me

There's a story of a young man
Who was taken from his home
He missed his sister become a woman
And his father growing old
From the distance he watched his mother
Mourn a loss, all alone
And when he thinks about his brother
He can't seem to find the phone
From the window of his life, he can see his home
As it passes by he feels a pain that no one knows
Past every better judgment,he packs his things to run away
Like an ocean distance is a beast that can't be tamed
Whoa, whoa, ooh
He left you behind
Now the young man roams the globe
Searching for the very thing he left at home
He searched far and wide, under every stone
The more he walked the more he was alone
This young man is a lot like me
Except he learned from those mistakes he made
If I don't slow down I'm afraid
I'll be trapped forever in this cage
From the window of my life I can see home
As it passes by I feel a pain no one knows
Past every better judgment I pack my things to run away
Like an ocean distance is a beast that can't be tamed
Whoa, Whoa, ooh
I left you behind!


I can't imagine how terrifying it must be
To live your life in a box, scared shitless of everything
You're the product of the world that's fed to you
You hate those who live a life you're not used to

You're looking for more
You follow a whore
On fire for Christ but your life is lukewarm
Evil and foul to the lives you dismiss
And I hate the fact that I let myself be pushed to this

This is a place of acceptance
Not a place of repentance
So save your breathe
You homophobic shithead

One day you will pay your debt but until then
I'll fight to undo every word that you've said

And every time you lift your hand to cast your stone
I'll find you and shove it back down your throat

I'm through acting civil
Now you know how I feel


Out of style out of date quick
You better start clearing out some closet space
Such a waste but tv has it justified
Life through western eyes
Homicidal kids, the drugs and the queer they have us all living in a culture of fear
And you better forget about trusting your peers
Life through western eyes
'What color is my safety today?'
'I drank water from the sink, do you think that's okay?'
'I really don't think it's safe to go outside to day.'
'This is what happens when we don't pray'
Increase the insanity, they have us right where they want us
By our heads and by our wallets
Another day locked in paradise
there 's nothing to see here so just close your eyes
Substance abuse declines while the war of drugs intensifies
You don't have to agree
This is called better safe than sorry
Life through western eyes
Too fat, too ugly, you will amount to nothing
You better pick the pace or you'll be stuck on the sidelines
Life through western eyes
This is life through western eyes
Life through western eyes
So you better not think just sit back and take another drink
Why swim when we can sink
Increase the insanity


YOU'RE DROWNING! 
you're drowning, you can't seem to catch your breath.
YOU'RE SEARCHING! 
You're searching, looking for the surface. 
YOU'RE FIGHTING! 
you're fighting,  looking for a purpose. 
in one fell swoop it could all be gone. 
what's the point to even carry on? 
you're better than this. the furthest thing from worthless. 
no regrets. no second guess. 
day by day keep 'ghting a little more. 
you're so much stronger than you give yourself credit for. 
i'm always here when you need my help, but in the end you must rely on yourself. 
YOU'RE DROWNING! 
you're drowning, you can't seem to catch your breath. 
YOU'RE SEARCHING! 
keep searching, looking for the surface. 
NO REGRETS, NO SECOND GUESS!


I found a place to belong
So I went all in
I walked right in the mouth of it
And never looked back again
The only thing that remains
Through the loss and the pain
As for me, there was no other choice
I'm married to the noise

We've been pushed to the side
While the fake walk the line
I've seen it all my life
You praise what is weak and keep carrying on
You cannot kill my will to belong

What's inside me still pushes on

I don't care if you can't see what I see
I'm still here
No, I don't care
I never needed a reason
Yeah, I'm still here

Through and through
This has always been my truth
And it can't be killed
So I won't let you crush what we built
Lost on you
Somewhere along the line you forgot
What this meant to all of us
And I've had enough

I don't care if you can't see what I see
I'm still here
No, I don't care
I never needed a reason
Yeah, I'm still here
So keep rolling your eyes
I'd rather be dead than settle with your way of life
So I don't care what you think about me
Yeah, I'm still here

Through the loss and the pain
The only thing that remains
And I was finally heard through the pain of my voice
As for me there was no other choice

I don't care if you can't see what I see
I'm still here
No, I don't care
I never needed a reason
Yeah, I'm still here
So keep rolling your eyes
I'd rather be dead than settle with your way of life
So I don't care what you think about me
Yeah, I'm still here

The only thing that remains
Through the loss and the pain
As for me, there was no other choice
I'm married to the noise


The perversion of life through gaia's eyes
As good as dead in the jaws of spite
I can't sit back as the apathy amplifies
In the darkest corners of their nightmare, I'll be a light
Count our blessings
No cover
Showered in life's warmth
The rest left to suffer
We are fortunate enough to make a choice
Count our blessings
No cover
Showed in life's warmth the rest left to suffer
We are fortunate enough to make a choice, I'll be a voice
They rest their eyes in a bed of filth and we suffer slow in a vice of guilt
I refuse to add to this violent design in the darkest corners of their nightmare
I'll be a light
Count our blessings
No cover
Showered in life's warmth the rest to suffer
We are fortunate enough to make a choice
Count our blessings
No cover
Showered in life's warmth
The rest left to suffer
We are fortunate enough to make a choice I'll be a voice
Cast out, forsaken. Desperate. Ill fated.
Everyday the value of life spreads thinner
But in this chaos will be a hopebringer
Their trials are mine, I stand for every single walk of life
I'll fight
I'll fight for both human and nonhuman rights because I know that things are much
brighter on the other side


Picture this
You're just a kid
They never noticed you because no one ever did
You don't know why but you don't mind
Your life already gives you a hard time
They saw you, your whole life, less like an underdog more like garbage
Do they know what it's like, to spend every single day with a back like a target?
A back like a target!
Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all
Woah!
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all
Woah!
We'll never be
We'll never see
Never believe the fucking lies they tell themselves
Don't tell me who to be
I put my faith in those who are just like me
We have no face
We have no name
And we never needed any of you anyway
Any of you anyway!
Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all
Woah!
For the first time i can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all
Woah!
Proud to be nobody! 
We never needed any of you anyway
Proud to be nobody! 
We never needed any of you anyway
Any of you anyway!
Trust me I know when you look at me you see nobody at all
Woah!
For the first time I can say that I'm proud to be nobody at all
Woah!
We'll never be
We'll never see
Never believe the fucking lies they tell themselves


I can't understand what I've done to deserve this
Please explain it to me
Beaten and broken, thrown out with the garbage
No one looking out for me
I'll be just fine, I have what it takes when I have to survive
Just tell me why
Do you decide my right to life
At the end of the day
With the wind in my face
My life goes on and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!
Crushed under the weight
Of a world that's left us behind
I'm done defending
Just because I'm loyal doesn't mean you owe me
I was nothing to no one
I was worthless and so on
I'm a son of a bitch
One glance made you sick
God did nothing so he doesn't exist
I was nothing to no one
Fucking worthless and so on
So young, so fucked, so numb
You'll see there's nothing you can do to me!
At the end of the day
With the wind in my face
My life goes on and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!
On and on and on and on
Now I can feel something
All the hurt I felt is gone
There's nothing you can do to me!
Now I know where I belong
I have a place to call home
I have been alone so long
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!
There's nothing you can do to me!

Half truths 
and whole lies 
simple words 
cant justify 
another lie 
another dies and 
another mother left to cry

another night 
another thousand lives 
when will we realize 
war will be 
our demise 
so unfortunate 
we cant sacrifice our pride

now a land 
being filled 
with the innocent blood we spilled 

what is left to say 
when the martyrs 
are left to their graves 
no real understanding of 
what it is they're dying for 
freedoms price seems 
too much to pay 
freedom for you and for me?
freedom from this 
awful tyranny 
consequently 
a choice has been made 
we've paid 
in full 
now we must accept this 
rising 
death 
toll.. 
relative truth has set a barrier down 
it seems that our hate 
is our only common ground.. with words we 
make 
sound 
but no real progress made 
in this escapade 
cultures set 
worlds apart 
this has failed from the start 
our lack of understanding and respect for those who would choose right 
to be left 

our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break
our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break
our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break
our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break
a faith only we could break
a faith only we could break
ONLY WE COULD BREAK

our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break
our placement has left them faithless 
a faith only we could break

how could we expect them to see 
eye to eye 
when we have them face down 
on their knees



The least that you can do
Is wipe off your shoes
Before you give yourself another boost.
I'll never stoop that low
Because I know 
That this is just a game to you.
You're all for show.

It's so hard to think of anyone else
When you're too busy thinking about yourself.

You've mastered the art of giving up
And I've had enough
I'm giving up on us.
So I'll cut my losses,
No more being cautious.
I'd rather lose it all than become thoughtless.

It's so hard to think of anyone else
When you're too busy thinking about yourself.

A person can only take so much
And I feel like I'm losing touch
So for your sake and everyone around us
I suggest that you back up.

I can't believe you tried to cheapen
Everything I have achieved.
I still stand for everything that I always believed
Was the biggest part of me.
Part of me.
Part of me.
Part of me.

So here we go,
You keep trying to pull me back down to zero.
But at the end of the day
I know I fought hard for everything
So do your worst
I can take anything.
I can take anything.
I can take anything!


My friend, what has you so troubled?
Why have you turned life into such a struggle?
I see it in you no matter how hard it tries to hide
The war in your heart and fire in your eyes
I can't follow, trust me I've tried
My path is lit by a brighter light
I will always sing humanity's song
We May fall but we will carry on
May these words ring loud


Revolutionary mental attitude!
Fuck the message, fuck it's good intensions
A new attitude for a new generation
You can't fight back if you won't stand up
Being positive is no longer enough
I take a stand to do what I can
And if I can't, I find out how I can
Control the feeling, organize, make a plan
Can't do it all, but look into the soul
And realize the role
Realize the role!
The words alone won't last
Fuck the message!


Black dynasty
You've defined true tragedy and this world bleeds
But I have found peace
As your enemy
As your betrayer
I am the traitor
Erida, I pray that the same hate that kills and rapes doesn't give way in my head
If it does, I'm as good as dead
You spread your mind plague to anyone who listens
I can't believe your hate has so much ambition
The infection you bleed of your own volition
It's not enough to make your own decisions
No more malice
Watch us break it
We want progress so we'll make it
This is a new kind of justice
We just have to take it
My mind is poised and the strike will be deadly
And you better believe I'm bringing all hell with me


In a world that can't, we can
In a world that hates, we understand
We are some kind of love, we're at the end of our rope
We are some kind of hate, we are some kind of hope in a world that can't, we can
In a world that hates, we understand
In a world that won't, well we've got the world by the throat
We are some kind of hope I'll see through every inch of doubt
I am the moon when the sun goes down
And I'll reflect its shine, its life. I will define
'I woke up today and felt my age for the first time, in both my mind and my body
And my thoughts are less of fitting in and more of being a better man'
Mike 'Owen' Kinsella, I just want to be a better man
A wrecking ball of warmth is beating in my chest
My head is buried in the depths of its gentleness
Oh god I am alive. Keeping warm in a cold world


What are you trying to prove?
Could it be that you're trying to prove that you have nothing left to lose? 
Well since when did this mean nothing to you?

As we lose everything we fought to hold on to we lost sight of the things that we know are true.

We continue to make the same mistakes we promised ourselves not to make. 

This is such an outrage. 
SUCH AN OUTRAGE! 
SUCH AN OUTRAGE!

As we lose everything we fought to hold on to we lost sight of the things that we know are true.

We continue to make the same mistakes we promised ourselves not to make. 

This is such an outrage. 

And we refuse to fall victim, to be cut short of full potential. 
We aren't asking you to understand but just to listen.

Because when it comes down to it its our heart that will prove who we are.

We will be heard. 
Every word. 
We will be heard. 
Not even violence can silence us.

And who are you to say (we) don't belong, to say what's right what's wrong. 
At the end of the day we'll still be here, when you turn and walk away. 

THIS IS SUCH AN OUTRAGE! (x4)

THIS IS SUCH AN OUTRAGE!
SUCH AN OUTRAGE!


I don't think I could ever let you go
But if you stay I know that I'll lose control
All the things that we've been through
I can't believe all I've done just to protect you
Suffocated by the thin line I walk between
Who I am and who I think I should be
Pointed every finger I could still nothing's right to me
I am the enemy
Such pain
Climbs like ivy from my feet to my face
My only enemy is me


La Poderosa

I'm breaking away from the pain and self-defiance
I've found my way in faith and self- reliance
I can say I stood to face the giant
But if I die, at least I'll die a lion.


Yeah

It's hard to find a way to express myself
But there's so much I owe to you
The only ones who deserve to hate me
Are the ones that love me the most

You are the ones
And you deserve the same
You are the ones
The only ones who ever stayed

I've learned so much from you and I
Will always walk right by your side
Keeper, I will defend your name
Just like you've defended mine

You are the ones
And you deserve the same
You are the ones
The only ones who ever stayed

Unbroken
The bond between you and I
Will always remain unbroken
No matter what the bastards of time may bring
We will always remain unbroken
Unbroken
Unbroken


Don't get me wrong
I'm grateful for the good intentions
You hung me on
Still there's a feeling like all the thing we left undone
Because the things I'm running from
We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down
But heavy lies the crown
(And don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)
Heavy lies the crown
Heavy lies the crown
You need to know
That I don't hold a thing against you
That much is true
You did what you could
Sometimes we get the best of ourselves
Break it down so we can rebuild
We can rebuild
We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down
But heavy lies the crown
(And don't you forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me
I understand the feeling of thinking you failed me
I understand the blaming and the pain that it brings
Just let it go
The pain that it brings
We can't escape the voices in our heads that break us down 
Heavy lies the crown
(Don't forget about me)
Maybe you need some time to walk it off and let it bleed
Just don't forget about me
(Just don't forget about me)
Just let it go
The regret and the pain that it brings
Heavy lies the crown
Heavy lies the crown

You've heard it all before
'This time won't be the same, you can trust me'
But you know my fucking game
Say what I have to, to get what I need
Now the evil delivered swings back at me

Weak attempts at change carry me backward
Too little, too late, now live with the hurt
For everything I have an excuse
But some things are not long hidden: 
The sun, the moon, the truth

Now I live with the hurt
Live with the hurt
This is what I deserve

Break me down, the only way I'll learn
The guilt is overwhelming
Take me out, the pain of me returns
My sins fucking destroy me

I am forced to face the fire I create
And watch as it annihilates everything
Hold me back while I watch it burn
The price I pay, the suffering returns

Now the hands of fate are here to collect
Nothing here is safe until I reflect
I run from myself, no end in sight
Numb on the inside from living a lie

Now I watch as it burns
Watch as it burns
This is what I deserve

Break me down, the only way I'll learn
The guilt is overwhelming
Take me out, the pain of me returns
My sins fucking destroy me

You can shelter yourself from the sun
And you can hide from the moon
But there is nothing you can do
When the truth strikes it's light on you

Now I must live with the hurt
Now I must live with the hurt

The pain of me returns
The pain of me returns
The pain of me returns

Now I must live with the hurt


Channel the struggle
Bind the weight to your back
And take the next step,
Another level, this is more than a war
It lives in every single breath
Embrace the damage
You have to walk this path alone!
Find who you are
Destroy and rebuild
Your fight is your own!
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh, it's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh the war inside!
The rage is a tool
Hammer down the hand that tries to control you
It's what you do, don't turn around
There's no going back to the old you
Use the pain!
Let it be the force that drives you
Everyday!
You have to decide
Survive the fight or defeat the war inside!
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's you life, it's your fight,
It's the war inside!
It's what we are, it's all we give 
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's you life, it's your fight,
It's the war inside!
Find the strength, pull the pin
Find the strength, pull the pin
Find the strength, pull the pin
You can be what you want to!
No one has known what you've had to go through
Live with the pressure to be truly free
No motherfucker will ever own me!
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!
It's what we are, it's all we give
It's all we have, we brave the wind
It's your life, it's your fight
It's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh it's the war inside!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Whoa-ohoh-oh the war inside!


Let this be known 
this is our cleansing
this is time for unity
this is time to break the distance set between you and me 

this is 
ours for the taking
and we've taken a turn for the worst 

everything we take for granted 
all these seeds of hate we've planted 
its time for the soil to be cleansed
we must change our ways 
if we want to amend

and I want nothing more then 
for these bounds to be finally set free  
and for us to take the first stride towards a positive way of life  

and this brotherhood has been misunderstood 
for something other than integrity  
and I refuse to sit back and lose 
my friends to this 
loss of dignity  

there is 
no 
There is no I in team(4x)  

BREAKIN THESE CHAINS
that bind us all  
RISE ABOVE
the apathy within us all(2x)

BREAK THESE CHAINS

RISE ABOVE



This is more than a pulse beneath my wrist 
or a beat beneath my ribs 
this is something that cant be given away
because what's life for some 
is not right for some 
but either way we can overcome and not be killed by our own mistakes
we can't let this be our death 
because our differences will be our expenses too 
relieve us and achieve something for us to believe 
we have been put up on the shelf 
it's such a sad day when we need to save each other from ourselves 

rest assured that with a heart that's pure we'll be victorious and not let our hate get the best of us

rest assured that with a heart that's pure we'll be victorious and not let our hate get the best of us

move.

rest assured that with a heart that's pure we'll be victorious and not let our hate get the best of us

rest assured... will get the best of us.


I will stay true to this  
I wont fall  
this means more now than ever before  your doubt 
drives me 
and I bite my tongue  

you hate me and everything I am  
and everything I believe  
say what you will 
cause I have learned 
to turn the other cheek  

say what you will  
say what you will

this is mine 
this is for me 
we will rise up together  
we are one 
we are family  
this world may bring us down  
but it cant 
tear apart 
this family  

be strong  
keep your head up  
because 
this struggle 
will only get harder to handle(2x)  

THIS IS WHERE 
MY HEART LIES!(4x)

this is where 
my heart lies(8x)

this is where 
my heart lies



I've lost count, of how many times
I've tried to reach you
You weren't coming
Have my messages gotten lost?
'Cause it's been twenty six years now, and still no response
Nonetheless I'll start from where I last left off.
Fill you in with everything that's been going on
It's been a bit overwhelming
But I'm sure all the letters have been more than telling.
(Yeah)
Yeah, you just ought to know! (you just ought to know)
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go.
I for one am better off without you (without you)
But there are those out there that really fuckin' need you (need you)
I've lost count, have my messages gotten lost?
(Of how many times I've tried to reach you)
'Cause it's been twenty six years now, and still no response.
Yeah, you just ought to know!
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go (Oh)
Yeah, you just ought to know! (you just ought to know)
I'm coming here, because I got nowhere else to go.
It starts with me
It starts with me
It starts with me
It starts with me
It starts with me
It starts with me
It starts with me


i've tried for so long to put this into words.
to capture the worth of ideas that are worth being heard.
we've worked for way to hard and worked for way to long just to be bound, gagged and thrown to the waiting dogs. 

but hey what do we know anyway?

so we'll keep to ourselves.
we've got nothing to say we're just here to entertain.
so now we'll listen when you say
"JUST SHUT UP AND BEHAVE."

ten dollars at the door,
just leave it here with everything you stand for.
we're not paying you to hear you talk,
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS!

stay calm, stay cool, just pull this through.
it's what they expect of you.

i'm about to lose control,
LOSE CONTROL,
AND WHO IS HELD RESPONSIBLE?
i want to know.

I'M ABOUT TO LOSE CONTROL!

so we'll keep to ourselves.
we've got nothing to say we're just here to entertain.
so now we'll listen when you say
"JUST SHUT UP AND BEHAVE."

ten dollars at the door, just leave it here with everything you stand for.
we're not paying you to hear you talk,
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS!

do what you're gunna do,
and say what you're gunna say
but in the end,
WE'RE HERE TO STAY!
WE'RE HERE TO STAY


When violence is the only language this world comprehends
Don't be surprised when it speaks in a way you can understand
Constant state of brutal aggression and total devastation
Relentless punishment warrants violent reactions

And we're all just hanging on by a thread
By a thread
By a thread

I can't believe you will not see
The ones you've come to hate are just like you and me
You can't bury me in your disbelief

You give your fear a face
And now you call it your enemy
It's all I see
It's all I fucking see

Such narrow understanding, just use your fucking head
You can't see past yourself, you're just as good as dead
I want no part of your one-sided perspective
I have no patience for your malicious intentions

I can't believe you will not see
The ones you've come to hate are just like you and me
You can't bury me in your disbelief

You give your fear a face
And now you call it your enemy
(You give your fear a face)
War is all I fucking see
It's all I see

You can't bury me
(You give your fear a face)
In your disbelief
(And now you call it your enemy)


I bet it feels so good, so good
Playing it off like you're so misunderstood
You found your place in your comfortable group
Hating everyone who's not like you

But tell me am I wrong?
You stand back and tell us, "You don't belong!"
Sorry, that's not your choice to choose
We'll never play by your rules

I bet it feels so good, so good
Playing it off like you've got nothing to lose
Help me out because I'm just a little confused
For being so punk you follow a lot of rules

You walk the walk
You've even got a mouth that never, never, never stops
So just run your mouth while you sit on your couch
Presuming to know what we're all about

But tell me am I wrong?
You stand back and tell us, "You don't belong!"
Sorry, that's not your choice to choose
But tonight we're gonna play by your rules

Just look at us now
We can do I too
We can be, be, be, be, be just like you
Run it, run it
Keep running your mouth
How do you like us?
How do you like us now?
Just remember when you point the finger
There's three pointing back at you

You think you're making the difference
You're setting the limits
A gathering of cynics
Not even worth this song hitting two minutes


We still believe

I'm sick and tired of all this giving up
All I hear is talk, and I've had enough
Single minded, overwhelmingly one sided
Refusing humanity, does not award morality
Hope's not dead so we'll forever scream
Until it's deafening

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe

You opened the gate
And what came rushing out
Is far too powerful for you to hold down
If there's a better way, someone please tell me now
But there's not, this is what

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe

From here on out, I will live
Deliberately!
I can't sit back, to watch the world die
I must fight back!
I'll pay the price, there's more to this
Not just me!

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake
While the world sleeps
Because we still believe
We are the ones, who will achieve
What the world dreams
Because we still believe


Frustration overwhelms me
Nothing left but this empty feeling
Rejection from the very same thing that gave me definition

So I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Fight the hand that bleeds me
Break the hand that cheats me
You will never defeat me

I would rather stand and fight without a chance at all
Than wait around for these "so called" friends to break my fall
You pass your judgement on me
When it's you who's buckling at the knees

We'll bite the hand that feeds us
Feeds us
We'll fight the hand that bleeds us
Bleeds us
We'll break the hand that cheats us
Cheats us
You'll never defeat us

We are stronger
And we fight harder
Than any makeshift martyr
Such an arrogant elite
Just begging to be heard
You scream word after hollow word
But now it's our turn

I've been there too
Alone in a crowded room
And they're all laughing at you
A room full of rolling eyes and self-doubt
Narrow minds and big mouths
You're not in this alone
And you don't have to feel that you are

We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll push forward regardless of the consequence
We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll keep pushing regardless

We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll push forward regardless of the consequence
We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll keep pushing regardless

We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll push forward regardless of the consequence
We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll keep pushing regardless


Frustration overwhelms me
Nothing left but this empty feeling
rejection from the very same thing that gave me definition

So ill bite the hand that feeds me 
Fight the hand that bleeds me 
Break the hand the cheats me
You will never defeat me

I would rather stand and fight with a chance at all than wait around to these "so called" friends to break my fall
you pass your judgment on me when its you whose buckling at the knees

So ill bite the hand that feeds us (x2)
Fight the hand that bleeds us (x2)
Break the hand the cheats us(x2)
You will never defeat us

We are stronger and we fight harder than any makeshift martyr
such an arrogant elite
just begging to be heard
You scream word after hollow word but now its our turn

Ive been there too
Alone in a crowded room and they're all laughing at you
A room full of rolling eyes and self doubt 
Narrow minds and big mouths 
You're not alone in this alone and you don't have to feel that you are

We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll push forward regardless of the consequence
We're what separates the heart from the heartless
So we'll keep pushing regardless(x3)


What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice?
What choice did you give them?
Bound to machines
An attempt to prevent further suffering
Played by the rules
Repaid unjustly
But the truth is this:
We will not hesitate
Do not allow a peaceful rage to become hate I promise you you'll regret the day
A stain that won't wash away
When it all falls down
While you're wondering
Where it all went
What it all meant
We'll have no words left
We may not be around
To see it fall into descent
We'll always be your enemy
So save your breath
What choice did you give us?
What choice?
If they never change, we'll never fade
We will never fade
If they refuse, we'll light the fuse
We'll light the fucking fuse
Look what we've done
We've created a fate
That we will never outrun
Time to change the path
Or be forced to forever live
With what can never be undone
When it all falls down
While you're wondering
Where it all went
What it all meant
We'll have no words left
We may not be around
To see it fall into descent
We'll always be your enemy
So save your breath
What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice did you give us?
What choice?
We will not hesitate
I promise you you'll regret the day
A stain that won't wash away


You're fed up it never shuts up, you're seeing red once again
You've had more than enough, patience wearing thin, your thoughts all turn to a blur
Your head and your heart turn to lightning and thunder,
All you want is five minutes of peace so you raise your fist and let loose the beast
What goes around, what goes around, what goes around, around and around,
What goes around, what goes around , what goes around, goes around and around and
Around we are your children raised with the back of a hand
I know that we've done wrong but we're not stupid
We've learned and we won't make the same mistakes
That you did


I live in the valley by the sea
Lined with the scent of orange trees
This is the place that's always loved me
I wake where the sun never sleeps
In-between the mountains and where the water and sky meet

This is the place I was raised
My family and my friends
This is my everything
This is the place I was saved
My beginning and end
I wouldn't trade it for anything

And just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind
I think about you all the time
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down
And I have seen a lot of amazing things
But there's no feeling like coming home brings
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down

Just look at the view
If this is wrong then I don't wanna be true
If you're not here then I don't wanna be you
Even if I tried I couldn't forget
It only makes sense that my heart belongs where the sun sets
And when I start to smell the salt from the sea
I know I'm close
I'm coming home

And just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind
I think about you all the time
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down
And I have seen a lot of amazing things
But there's no feeling like coming home brings
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down

And just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind
I think about you all the time
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down
And I have seen a lot of amazing things
But there's no feeling like coming home brings
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down

I think about you all the time
Down, down, never bring me down
Down, down, never bring me down


Our heroes left to die
We push our young ones to the side
And hung bright minds out to dry
In the downpour
We'll drown if we don't find some truth
This is our nation without a roof
The fire of this hopelessness ignites
The fury of misfortune strikes
Supreme isolation reigns, the wolves are at the door
We walk on common ground. It's in our hearts to help those that have been shut out
And if just one, we are all the tired and the poor
So lift your lamp before we break down the door
New colossus, they fall on blind eyes and your teeming shores
They multiply. Naked as the birth of a new day
Amazing grace please show your sick and hungry a new fate
The wolves are at the door, we walk on a common ground
It's in our hearts to help those that have been shut out
And if just one, we are all the tired and the poor
So lift your lamp before we break down the door
It is the obligation of those who have everything to help those who have nothing

C'mon
Drop auto logic
You thought you could get wit'
Me and Tommy hittin' man
Cold dropped a smash hit
Angry as a battery
Back in the funk
'Cuz I'm not frontin'
Commin' upon the stage I'll say ya somethin'
Clear as a project
The style is hectic
Guess I'm left with
A system sceptic
The truths I'm droppin'
From the pulpit I'm yellin'
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion
Word is a rough mix
Sign of justice
The rhyme is allowed 'cuz you can't philabust this
Style I'll catch ya
I'll catch ya the rapture
Ya murdered my level head
Ya know that I have to...

Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

Stop before you take a wrong turn
Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned
Stop and just listen
I'm dismissing competition with decisions
So I guess you'll have to listen and learn

Creative
So what ya gonna do?
Ain't no fading
So what ya gonna do?
Grab the microphone and say a check one two
The kid's solo
Unafraid of any crew
'Cuz I'm the type of mother with the maddest
Status
Statue or poll
Paid in full
No bull never dull
Always in control
Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll
Ugh...huh...huh

(speaking)
Awww ya...
It goes a just like that...ya...
Now break it down...

Auto logic
On auto pilot
Silence equals death
And death equals silence
The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind
Is a crew that looses power over time
And now that ya finally woke up
Yo wish your mother fuckin' ass would have spoke up
Voices in full
The balled of the bullet
The mic is a trigger and I pull it
Droppin' and smashin'
Thrashin' and bashin' the set
Mentally and spiritually correct
Back!...and ya know it's a treat
'Cuz every time I step ya know I won't forget ta...

Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

Auto logic (go...go...go...go...)
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

Auto logic (go...go...go...go...)
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic
C'mon!


It's a beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care makes me want to say 
It's a beautiful world
Oh what a beautiful world 
For you

It's a wonderful time to be here 
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair makes me want to say 
It's a wonderful place 
Oh what a wonderful place
For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, not me

This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue
When ya blood was red
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head

Blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head

I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralised?
So serene on the screen
You was mesmerised
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold
Turn ya to stone before ya realise

They load the clip in omnicolour
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Run it!

(Guitar solo)

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Check-a, check-a, check it out
They load the clip in omnicolour
Said they pack the 9, they fire it at prime time
The sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds

No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say how high
Ya brain-dead
Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Yeah
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Uggh! Yeah! Yea!

Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya gotta bullet in ya head

Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya gotta bullet in ya head

A bullet in ya head (8 times, building to a shout)
A bullet in ya head (7 times, shouted/screamed)
Ya gotta bullet in ya fuckin' head!
Yeah!
Yeah! (Sustained to end of drum roll)

This voice shatters the calm of the day like an alarm,
So wake up bright anew and take up arms,
'Cause more is necessary than vocabulary war,
'Cause the toxic rock (crack) import's hitting on your door.
CIA, I'll see you later 'cause your time is coming soon.
I flip this shit like Pacino and it's your dog day afternoon.
Attica, Attica, drug agents you bring your static-a.
My alphabet will slash and then can flip you automatic-a,
Dramatic like Ali-Shaheed Mohammed* brought the vibes.
I bring the sun at red dawn upon the thoughts of Franz Fanon.
So stand at attention devil ???,
You'll never survive choosing sides against the Wretched of the Earth (Fanon's book).
The infiltrator,
??? intoxicator,
People incarcerator,
Liberation movement annihilator.
We got you clocked pushing rocks and it fell.
We got brothers trooping subways like the Ho Chi Minh  trail.
We got the truth addict, Last Emperor, KRS and history manifested.
Tomorrow tha next lesson.

You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
You know the cops, they got a network for the toxic rock.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that .
So get that flashlight outta my face.
You claim I'm selling' crack but you be doing' that.
The Last Emperor, KRS-One 
Big Zack.

As free-market capitalism and technology expands,
The third world's fertile soil becomes a desert wasteland.
So it takes ??? to demand the government provide answers,
When Lady Liberty has me bewitched like Samantha,
And poverty is one of the most malignant forms of cancer.
To all my black magik romancers and acid rain dancers,
Develop close ties like Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza.
We fear no man and throw jams that attack counter-intelligence programs.
Exciting like the epic adventures of Conan,
I colonize minds like Zaire by the Belgians.
Now what hell is the problem with this system and what it sells us?
I bring ancient relics like Wyclef did to zealots.
I saw an iron curtain called hip-hop and got it open like Boris Yeltsen.
Whirlwind tornadoes in the rain forest if you say so.
KRS and the Last Emperor war like the Green Hornet and Kato.
Zack de la Rocha brings the enraged flow.
But all three drop science and become the most powerful alliance since NATO.

Need I say the CIA be criminals in action,
Cocaine crack-unpacking, high surveillance-tracking.
Prominent blacks and whites giving orders for mass slaughters.
I want all my daughters to be like Maxine Waters.
When they flooded the streets with crack cocaine I was like Noah,
Now they ???? 'cause the whole Cold War is over.
Communism fell to the dollars you were grabbing.
All the assault and battering in the name of intelligence-gathering
Now it's karma you're battling--a losing fight.
I choose the mic to recite, ignite light in the night, aight.
We should beat em, President Clinton should delete 'em.
It's not hard, the CIA simply has no more job.
Oh my goddess, mother, you can fix this.
We rock over mixes, not 666s.
Yo, this is the message to all that can hear it.
If you got secret information now's the time to share it.
Call your congresswoman, your senator, your Mayor.
It's time for all the scholars to unite with all the playas.
Rearrange and see, times is definitely changing, G.
They used to tap the phone now they tapping while you paging me
It's crazy B. yet it's plain to see who's the enemy. Who's left?
The NRA, the ATF, the AMA? OK, OK, it's all irrelevant
'Cause in the new millennium there'll be no central intelligence.

Clamp down

What are we gonna do now?
Yeah, Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clamp down
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?

The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time boy there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think somebody could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

You grow up and you calm down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
You're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Take your gun, kill now

In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
But ha! Gitalong! Gitalong!
waiting to be nothing now
waiting to be nothing now
c'mon
oww shit

Are you ready?
You think you can tell us what to do?
You think you can tell us what to wear?
You think that you're better?
Yeah, well you better get ready,
To bow to the masters.

BREAK IT DOWN!

DeGenerate into somethin' fool
I just got tired of doing what you told me to do
That's the breaks boy, yeah, that's the breaks litle man
Break it down!

D-Generation-X! D-Generation!

You think you can tell me what to do?
Do you know who your talking to?
Well you better get used to the way the ball bounces
I've seen what you got, it measures in ounces

That's the breaks boy, yeah, that's the breaks litle man
Break it down!

D-Generation-X! D-Generation!

You think your a big man?
I'll treat you like your a little man.
So tell me what it's like to be half a man
It must break your heart to see what I am, but

That's the breaks boy, yeah, that's the breaks litle man
Break it down!

D-Generation-X! D-Generation!
D-Generation-X! D-Generation!




Greed!
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system, responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide...

Spoken:
'AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments they don't mind the procrastination
They say
"We'll kill them off,
take their land
and go there for vaction."'

My people's culture was strong, it was pure
And if not for that white greed
It would've endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds enslaved
Their souls encaged
I feel the rage
It's brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
The bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide...

Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find that I choke
Ya fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well I'll strike a match and it'll catch and
Spread the insight we need
A tiny fire, burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed


Down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around on a real low mind
See a pretty thing, in a wall
See a pretty thing, in a wall

In a wall
In a wall
In a wall

Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love
Yeah deep in the night I'm lost in love
A thousand eyes they look at you
A thousand eyes they, they look at you

Oh come on! 
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh come on!
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh come on!
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh come on!

Where faces shine
A real low mind
Faces shine
A real low

Oh come on!
Yeah yeah yeah

Oh come on!

Good Evening,

We want to just quickly send a nice friendly message 
to uh, Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia.

Here's something nice and friendly,
Here's something nice and friendly,
Here's something nice and friendly,
and it goes something like this.

Fuck tha police,
Comin straight from the underground.
Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown,
And not the other color so police think,
They have the authority to kill a minority.

Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one,
For a punk mutha fucka with a badge and a gun,
To be beatin on, and throwin in jail.
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell.

Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager,
With a little bit of gold and a pager.
Searchin my car, lookin for the product.
Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics.

You'd rather see me in the pen,
Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo.
Beat tha police outta shape,
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,
To mark off the scene of the slaughter.
No controller, bread and water.

A young nigga on a warpath,
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,
Of cops, dyin in L. A.

Yo, I got somethin to say.
Fuck the police,
Comon! Off, What?
Fuck the police,
Yeah!
Comon!
Fuck tha police,
Yeah.

Fuck The police, 
Comin straight from the underground.
Young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown,
And not the other color so police think,
They have the authority to kill a minority.

Fuck that shit, cuz I ain't tha one,
For a punk mutha fucka with a badge and a gun,
To be beatin on, and throwin in jail.
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell.

Fuckin with me cuz I'm a teenager,
With a little bit of gold and a pager.
Searchin my car, lookin for the product.
Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics.

You'd rather see me in the pen,
Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo.
Beat tha police outta shape,
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,
To mark off the scene of the slaughter.
No controller, bread and water.

I don't know if they fags or what,
Search a nigga down and grabbin in the nuts.
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none.
But don't let it be a black and a white one.
Cuz they slam ya down to the street top,
Black police showin out for the white cop.

Yeah, my brothas will swarm,
On any mutha fucka in a blue uniform.
Just cuz we in Washington D.C, punk police are afraid of me.
Hey!

Punk on a warpath,
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,
Of cops, dyin in L. A.

Hey yo, We got somethin to say.
Fuck the police,
Comon, sing that shit,
Right now,
Comon!
Comon!
One more time,
Here we go, here we go,
Comon!
One More, We gotta do it, right now,
Yeah,
Check it out.

Hey don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah of the funky buddah
Eluder of the fucked up style's that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
Cause we're like outlaws striding while suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving by'
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand

I be doing all the dumb shit yo
Cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
Humming coming at ya! then you know I had to gat ya!
Time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
In to your satellite shining a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example just a little sample:
How could I just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on. take cover son or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To lite my spliff ignite you with insite so if you ain't down
Bullshit. say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!
Yeah you know I'm going to gat ya, how do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a faster ducket
Just to stay alive yo I got to say fuck it
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

How I could just kill a man
How I could just kill a man


Coolin' on the scene like a horse in a stable
A brother got ill and tried to snatch a fat cable
I stepped back, like it wasn't no thing
I punched him in the jaw with the fat gold ring
I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z you was packin'? You know I was strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
That can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross
Take me to the bar for the drink and make a toast
Givin best wishes to the best MC
And when the spot is blown ayo you know it's me
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin'

Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Coolin' at a party, no better yet disco
Head feelin' mellow from a bottle of Cisco
Move
To crush and fry a sucker MC like crisco
Gimme the cue, check one two
Don't try to come off on me, because you doo-doo
You treatin' me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon Why Z? 'Cause you a star
This is the year when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin'
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
'Cause I'm housin'
Because I'm housin', 'cause I'm housin'

Because I'm housin'
Come on

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
'Cause I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'

Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin'
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb

Relate to the matter, relate to the matter
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin')
Relate to the matter, relate to the matter
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb ('cause I'm housin')
'Cause I'm housin'


You tell me you like the taste
You just need an excuse
You tell me it calms your nerves
You just think it looks cool

You tell me you want to be different
You just change for the same
You tell me it's only natural
You just need the proof
Did you fucking get it?

It's in my eyes

And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

You tell me that nothing matters
You're just fucking scared
You tell me that I'm better
You just hate yourself

You tell me that you like her
You just wish you did
You tell me that I make no difference
Well at least I'm fucking trying
What the fuck have you done?

It's in my eyes

And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes 
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes


I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened it and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like myself because I never did
I wasn't with it but just that very minute
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me, begin to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They criticize me for some crime

I got a letter, I got a letter, I got a letter
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never
Mmm, mmm, mmm
It occurred to me, the suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before

How long has it been? They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run
I'm not a fugitive on the run

Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off
Many switch in, switch on, switch off

Nevertheless they could not understand
I am a black man and I could never be a veteran
On the strength of situations, I'm real
I got a raw deal, so I'm lookin' for the steel, looking for the steel

I got a letter from the government the other day
Opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me givin' a damn, I said, never

Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself, because I never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute

I'm not a fugitive on the run, I'm not
I'm not, I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me, begun to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
They'll criticize me for some crime

I got a letter from the government the other day

We gotta kick 'em out

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
'Cause we all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy

I know how you want it
When you're hot and tight
The girl can't stand it
When you're doing it right when they're up on the stand
Let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we're gonna kick 'em out

And I'm startin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling now baby
And the sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'
You gotta have it baby
You can't do without
You get that feelin' gotta kick 'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out

Got to get it up
You know you can't get enough miss Mckenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane' a loopy frenzy
We got a guitar and a crash on the drums
If you wanna keep on rockin' till the mornin' comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams,  yeah kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane
It's a shame 
The way she makes me 
Scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on, nah
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Nah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
And he hands you a dime
And he asks you with a grin
If you're havin' a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for, nah
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
I ain't gonna work, nah 
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
And everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's twenty-four
I ain't gonna work for, nah 
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They sing while they slave and just get bored
I ain't gonna work on, nah 
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

Wild International

They say that in war
That truth be the first casualty
So I dig in selector
I the resurrector
Fly my shit sever your neck
Wider than ever
With my tongue dipped in funk arsenic
Burn this illusion, this lie
This straight arson shit
Your arsenal stripped
Power ain't full jackets and clips
It's my ability to define phenomenon
Raw Crenshaw '84
Boogie down before
L.A. when the war break off
Where you be take off
Stand in full face off
With the M1 millimeter
Let the rhythm of the chamber hit 'em
Let the rich play catch with 'em
Better yet make 'em eat 'em and shit 'em
Till they so full of holes
That they drown in their own
I'm like a nail stuck
In the wrist of they Christmas
Don't need radio
To leave their family a witness

Muhammad and Christ word life
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

In this era where DJs behave
Be paid to be slaves
We raid airwaves to be sane
And what's raining from the station
Cash fascination
Like living dead fed agents
Distract us fast
From a disaster's wrath for sure
Air war was flooded like the 9th ward
On the AM, on the AM
Turn and face them
Hatred and mayhem
Slay them, dangerous
I take razor steps
It's the swing from the bling
To the bang on the left
It's the murderous return
Boom back full strap
Your six that got clipped
You can't clap back
With minimal lift
And criminal flow
I'm killing them soft
And billing them for
Everything stole
And once again I'm that nail
In the wrist of they Christmas
Watch me make their family a witness

Muhammad and Christ word life
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

Both Muhammad and Christ
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

International
International

Muhammad and Christ word life
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

Both Muhammad and Christ
Would lay your body down
To a tune so wild international
In the desert full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome with my verse
With my body rock

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

I was raised in the hood called what the diffrence
The brothers in the hood be chivalrous
So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap its on your lips so track shot
A steel dick more clip for pump but
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is
In my civic or in this show biz
I drill the fool, kill the fool
Come on what you say?
I think I can take care of all you muthafuckas don't delay right away

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?
Cause tricks be out for your blindside
Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
If you got none buy a shotgun
Got a new new style
Around me

Are we getting along? We family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns, allright man

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fucking with other niggas shit, but they can't be fucking with mine


Earth shares what Earth receives
And now only blood brings life
A tiller bring life, producer bring life
Protector bring life, soiled hands bring life

The tree of democracy shall be watered by the blood of revolution
So go plant a seed, go plant a seed for harvest
Go plant a seed for harvest producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer, producer, producer
Producer, producer

And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall
It all shall fall

I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a social experiment
Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance and greed
Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners
As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my submission 
I bacame an indentured servant in a factory
Where I myself was the product
Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces
Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me

So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes

And every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me
So that every thought I express
Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks
And set fire to their homes

And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes
And set fire to their homes

And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall by the grace of the people and
It all shall fall

Fall
Fall
Fall
Fall
Fall
Fall

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now

We're the renegades of this time and age
This is the time and age of renegades
Renegades of this time and age
This is the time and age of renegades

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were renegades of their time and age
The mighty renegades

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like
Zulu nation

Revelations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades we're the people
With our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me

C'mon
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop

We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals
'Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh

There was a time when our music
Was something called the Big Street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man to the dance floor

Say jam sucker (jam sucker)
Say jam sucker (jam sucker)
Say move sucker (move sucker)
Say groove sucker (move sucker)
Say dance sucker (dance sucker)
Say dance sucker (dance sucker)
Now move sucker (move sucker)
Now move sucker (move sucker)

Say jam sucker (jam sucker)
Say jam sucker (jam sucker)
Say move sucker (move sucker)
Say groove sucker (move sucker)
Say dance sucker (dance sucker)
Say dance sucker (dance sucker)
Now move sucker (move sucker)
Now move sucker (move sucker)

A weh weh weh weh woer
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

A weh weh weh weh woer
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

A weh weh weh weh woer
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

A weh weh weh weh woer
We're the renegades of funk
We're the renegades of funk

Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like
Ellison
Main line adrenaline Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin' in
I cook back the sling
To stone a settler and breaks him off clean
Call me the upsetter
Here come the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, tha pale families, the
Fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch
The cell dors crash
And the master's drums echo
Roll right
Roll call
Now we're alright
We're all calm
This hits like fists
Bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo I spark fear in the pigs
In the park
Head crack, I hijack the papars and the vapors
Caught fire up in you mind
Come back, rewind one time
Here come the hands on the leashes
The cross, the capital, the pale families, the
Fear and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch
The cell doors crash
And the master's drums echo
Roll right
Roll call
Now we're alright
We're all calm

Ain't no funk, it's funky, it's Doggystyle
(Death Row-ow, Death Row)

Shucks, stomping in my big blue chucks
More bounce to the ounce while I'm ditching you klutz
Bump-bump-bump-bump while you're bumping your sounds
It's the zoo and the Pound we don't fuck around
Relax your mind and let your conscience be free
And get down, stomping grounds is the LBC
I slid up out the game and MC's get wacked
But now I'm back (Oh shit!), so go get your strap
Watch your head, I break bread
Wit G's, Muslims, hard-heads and dreds
Bounce, rock while rollerskating
On them 20 inch tires with the platinum Daytons
I'm not that BG popping all that junk
About "I'll fuck you up", he sound like a punk
I been there and done that, no inspiration
All day demonstration beat conversation

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been working on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study wrong'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuck against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shake up for the sake of spending dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Killing up crews, give em the real street blues
Have em sliding in their eel-skins, grooving in their tennis shoes
Of course it don't stop being a Westside ridah
Wit no tattoos that's how they got you
I lay conversation on wax and CD's
BG's and originals, here come the mission
Making biters ride the Pound for the rest of the season
Doggy DPG ya lil homey
Look, I represent the LBC-ment
Windows tint, nigga that's the president
I hit you with a tune every blue moon
Collard on your plate so you can stuff it in your face
Nigga say your Grace before you touch your plate
It taste like it's laced but it ain't
This one puff uncut, no doubt
Everybody know I gotta ounce in the house

Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this
Snoop, come bounce to this

Snoop
Death row. 1-9-9-7. Snoop DOGG. Rage Against the Machine.
Rock and roll hip hop.

You thought I'd fall off. I'll fall off into this dope-ass rock and
Roll track. Y'know?

Charlie Wilson. Bow down.
This is crackin' y'all. This how we doin' it.
You know.

Bitch!

Bounce to this


Woop-woop! 
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop! 
That's the sound of the beast!

[Verse One:]

Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say "see ya" Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two:]

Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye 
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word "overseer," like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer 
Overseer 
Overseer 
Overseer 
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary 
Him want it 
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]





Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
'Cause summers here and the time is right for fighting in the street, boy
Tell me what can a poor boy do
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for a street fighting man

A street fighting man

Do you think the time is right for a palace revolution
Where I live the game to play is compromise solution
Well then what can a poor boy do
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for a street fighting man

A street fighting man

Well what else can a poor boy do?

Hey my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
Well what can a poor boy do
For sing for a rock 'n' roll band
In this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for
For a street fighting man

A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man
A street fighting man
For a street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

A street fighting man

Man walks along the railroad track
He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, no rest!

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom said; "Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies strugglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me!

And the highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of Tom Joad


Drop it 
Hey 
Ugh 

Try to crack 
And some will react 
Vocal snap so trap 
I'm trying to rap 

Those who try to subdue 
the truth 
lose their condition 
were labelled inactive 

Being 91 
the twentieth century 
Brooklyn is a magnum in the bottle of kerosiene 

flame ignites into the black 
sending fright 
thought you could read minds 
and words and insight 

Backin' the explosion on stage 
guns fear 
Frances Fanon 
presence of war 

Using my brain 
Until the power is obtained 
Using my strength to gain 
A struggle for rage 

But I 
Choose another tune to uplift 
Yeah, you know my anger is a gift 
a gift to expect the test we all must face 
Hah, 
Out my face 

Release the reason 
Allow the pain 
The actors change 
But the plays the same 

C'mon 
In the narrows 
In the narrows 
In the narrows 

Some are the holders of power 
But the style will [ ? ? ] shower 
Trying to like brothers about the structure itself 
Pay only motivates and creates more hate 

State to state 
I set it straight 
I investigate 
Debate, the [ ? ? ] who brought me lessons 

At the oppression I react with aggression 
Yo 
My section after section 

No need for repressing 
Just take a mic 
and a rap another session 

No need for guessing 
Yeah 
And that shit that your stressin' 

Release the reason 
Allow the pain 
The actors change 
But the plays the same 

Release the reason 
Allow the pain 
The actors change 
But the plays the same 

C'mon 

In the narrows 
In the narrows 
In the narrows 

Ugh! 

UGH! 

I'm on the mic 
Stepping up to sucka's 
while were drumming out the style 
and I do it with a smile 

When I put punks on trial 
Taking 'em back again 
Yeah the name of the comprehender 

The style I drop is going on and on 
To the punks to recognize the style 
Andrealize 
That I'm not no Punk Kid 
Just stepping up for the mic hit 

Ugh! 
In the narrows 

In the narrows 
In the narrows 
In the narrows 

Ugh!

[Maynard:]
Living on the street shores
He didn't learn and wanted children
Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"
He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]
He didn't wanna deal with it
Here they come, feelings that come as natural
Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all
He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]
Running away, getting some kinda cure
"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Give him your love, give him your love to save him

[Maynard:]
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Don't run away, give him your love to save him
Give him your love, give him your love to save him
Give him your love...

[Zach:]
Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves
Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness
Suicide or a slower death from addiction
seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor wage war
To reclaim their name

Zapata's blood

Wasn't spilt in vain

So now the most poor wage war
To reclaim their terrain

On January 1st , 1994
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico
Declared war on an unjust
and illegitimate government

Out of the debt of the most wild, the most poor
Came a just arm struggle
for democracy, justice, and liberty
And it won't stop until that 65 year old dictatorship, 
the Partido Revolucionario Institucional
(Institutional Revolutionary Party) is buried in the 
ground
and the people's voice is heard once again

Yeah

So check it out:
On January 1st, of 94 they became known as 
the Zapatista movement
And they have a saying, and I want you all to 
sing along with me real quick.
It goes something like this
It goes everything for everyone...
and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Yeah, sing that shit...
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.
Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves...


Let's change the subject to someone else
You know lately I've been subject to change
Normally I reel in the strange
Hangover, I'm older

You're one to talk, the heart is a clock
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away
Counting down to detonate
You will need an army to summon me

It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

My past is getting us nowhere fast
I was never one for taking things slow
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go
Come over, and over

Doing my time for line after line
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with
I'm holding, still holding
Holding you in

It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you, ooh, ooh
It doesn't matter much to me
If it doesn't matter much to you

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh
Where the hell are you? Ooh, ooh
Where the hell are you?

It's just a matter of time before, before
It's just a matter of time before, before
And though I hate to rewind before, before
It's just a matter of time

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time
Time


There's a place I'd love to go,
Strangers they can meet there,
Dream about the day I lernt to fly.
I'm afraid of airaplains,
Even though I like their wings,
Fears to be a person in the sky.

It's alright.
And it's good this time.

I look out and on the ground,
Really don't believe it,
Gravity can pull me from this hight.
One day we'll come crashing down,
What will I do,
Never had a chance to say goodbye.
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight
this time.
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight,
And it's good this time.
I looked down out on the ground,
I looked down out on the ground,
I looked down out on the ground,
I look out we're going down.


Dear Haley
Can you save me from
The borrowed cloud I'm on
All you've gotta do is try
Pray you're just getting by

Hey wait I thought you made it
How'd your bottled crown fall off
Tell me how'd you get so tired
Fade it down to the wire

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time

So very ordinary
Wait until my bomb goes off
See the actors run and hide
Fake it all in stride

One day we all can say where we're gone
And haunt the ground we're from
Everything's so open wide
Hear within the divide

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time

Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life

Try living a lie and kicking out
The same old guise
Wasting time


All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day

When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Calm down don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve (one by one hidden up my sleeve)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide (on and on I've got nothing to hide)

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Then I'm done done on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done done and I'm on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next

Done done on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next one
Done done on to the next one
Done I'm done and on to the next

Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Done done on to the next one
And I'm done and on to the next


They knew all along
They're not dumb, they were so wrong
She's not always fun
Hate it now, call when I'm done

Pieces fell in place
Puzzles suck, laugh in my face
Turn and swing the pace
I'll give this, keep the good waist

Head is on
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target
Metronome
I want out
I'm alone and I'm an easy target

Crazy TV dreams might be true
Not what it seems.
Food and cavities, chewing words
Tear at the seams
He don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that he should
I don't feel so good, don't feel bad
Not that I should

Did you ever listen?
Get out


When she goes storming out
I run for cover
Rolling like thunder clouds
Hanging above her

Ring in the witching hour
Spells that I'm singing
Rain come and drown me out
Sinking deep alone

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and

We could just lay around
Stare at the ceiling
Want to forget about
One for the feeling

Room full of photographs
Box full of letters
Come on make it last
Nothing else matters right now

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out

Can you go another round?
I will follow you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out

Let's go another round
I will bother you down and out
Let's go another round
I will follow you down and out


Ain't that the way it always starts
A simple round of conversation
Became a shameful equation
I flipped you station to station

Hey, don't go and turn the other way
Don't say there's nothing more to say
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down
Button up don't make a sound

Shame, shame, go away
Come again some other day
You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up

And when you said I couldn't give you enough,
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria,
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

Chase all of those memories away
Save them all for another day
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you

Wait, I wanna see if you can change
I wanna keep all I can take
I feel much better now
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms
My sweet Virginia
I'm the same as I was in your arms

Shame, shame go away, come again some other day
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away
Hush, now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground
Come now, take the blame, that's OK I'll play the game
I don't care it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day

You used to say I couldn't save you enough
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up
And when you said I couldn't give you enough
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria
Oh God you gotta make it stop

My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop
My sweet Virginia
Oh God you gotta make it stop


She was a friend of mine
Alone on a dead end street
Dancing through life
On the front lines

She led a quite life
Ends, they don't always meet
Years passed her by
Waiting to rise

She had arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind

Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away

Under a silent light
Screaming biology
Queen Gemini
The world in her sights

I want a new life
Forming inside of me
Blessed and born
Into this fire

You had arrows in your eyes
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind

Arrows in her /your eyes  ??
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind
Shame in your cries

Arrows in your eyes
Tears in your arteries
War in your mind
Shame as you cry
Fire away

Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away


You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself
And you bleed and breath the air
And its on and on and on and on and on

I just kinda died for you
You just kinda stared at me
We will always have the chance
We can do this one more time

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

You believe there's somewhere else
Where it's easier than this
And you see outside yourself
And you buy the hole you'll fill
And it's on and on and on and on and on

Hell yeah, I remember aurora
Hell yeah, I remember aurora
All this time
Hell yeah, I remember aurora

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
On and on and on aurora
Wait for everyone
Wait till the last one's done

Take me now
You spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out
Then we turn and come back down
Turn and come back down
Turn and come back down

On and on and on and on...


You got a bad reputation.
That's the word out on the town.
It gives a certain fascination.
But it can only bring you down.

You better turn yourself around.
Turn yourself around.
Turn it upside down.
Turn yourself around.

You had bad breaks, well that's tough luck.
You play too hard, too much rough stuff.
You're too sly, and so cold.
That bad reputation has made you old.

Turn yourself around.
Turn yourself around.
Turn it upside down.
Turn yourself around.

(guitar solo)

You better turn yourself around.
Turn yourself around.
Turn it upside down.
Turn yourself around.


Winding you way down to baker street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away 
And forget about everything

This city's dance makes you feel so cold
Its got so many people but its got no soul
And its taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now

Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
Opens the door
He's got that look on his face
And he asks you were you've been
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down 
In some quiet little town 
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone

When you wake up its a new morning
The sun is shining its a new morning
You're going, your going' home


[Instrumental]


Stuck inside these four walls
Sent inside forever
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you, mama
You, mama
You

If I ever get out of here
Thought of giving it all away
To a registered charity
All I need is a pint a day
If I ever get out of here
If we ever get out of here

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash
As we fell into the sun
And the first one said to the second one there
"I hope you're having fun"

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
Seeing no one else had come
And a bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the jailer man and sailor Sam
Were searching everyone
For the band on the run
Band on the run

We're the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run

Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down
In the town, they're searching for us everywhere
But we never will be found

Band on the run
Band on the run
And the county judge who held a grudge
Will search forever more
For the band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run
Band on the run


I'm no devil and I'm no saint
But i know what to do
With a little bit here and a little bit there
I'm gonna bring it home to you

I can change my ways, I can stretch my days
You know i payed my dues

Erase my name for you
Life ain't fair, but nothing compares
When I'm bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)

We can share this blame, you can dance on my grave (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
I will swing along with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
If you're not scared, we can wake the dead (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
When I'm bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)

I'll keep bangin' on with you
Bangin' on with you
There's nothing i can say or do
Bangin' on with you

Hang on we'll beat this out (Whoa-o)

I'll keep bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i can say or do
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)

Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i'd rather say or do
Bangin' on with you 

Hang on we'll beat this out 
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
Hang on we'll beat this out
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
Hang on we'll beat this out!
Hang on we'll beat this out of you
Hang on we'll beat this out!
Hang on we'll beat this out

Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i can say or do
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)

Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
Bangin' on with you (Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa, Oh Whoa)
There's nothing i'd rather say or do
Bangin' on with you


I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you

Were you born to resist or be abused?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and onto someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
The life, the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust, you must
Confess

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new

Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
Its real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must
Confess
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Oh


Breaking the static, a life automatic.
Everyone mad about you.
Look like a dirty old bruise, face like a faded tattoo.

Life imitated, it's so inflated.
Tired of waiting on you.
What did you want me to do, sit here and dream about...

Oh no, oh no, oh no!

You know you're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know i'm better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Now that you're sane and the picture you painted.
Don 't really look much like you.
Little more long in the tooth, what do you know about truth?
Is it there and it's just interfering, life isn't fair but i knew.
What if i'm haunted by you, everytime that i...

Oh no, oh no, oh no!

You know you're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know we're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

You are my favorite disaster.
Finally time to clear the air.

Just don't forget to breathe.
Please don't forget to breathe.
Everyone's better off this way.

So take it away.
Take it away.
Take it away.

You know you're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know we're better off you bastard, bastard, bastard.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Just don't forget to breathe.
Please don't forget to breathe.
Everyone's better off this way.

So take it away.
Take it away.
Take it away.

Go!


When I talk about it
It carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons
All renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

When I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew

But it's you I fell into

When I talk about it
It carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons
All renew

Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

Well I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

I fell into
I fell into


You make me dizzy
Running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout

You can see this on my face
It's all for you
The more and more I take I break right through
Therapy still scares me
Putting me on my back again
I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days I'll phase you out

Burn it in the blast off
Burn it in the blast off
Watch me crawl away
Try to get out
Try to get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

Breakout!
Go, go, go

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout


These are my famous last words
My number's up bridges will burn
Oh won't you let me twist your fate
It's getting kinda late

And I don't wanna wait no more
Oh may I have this dance of days
Locked in your embrace
You passed your test of faith

Another time, another place, another line upon your face
Another in your wake
Down crooked stairs and sideway glances comes the king of second chances
Now throw him in the flames

Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)
Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Oh let me put you in your place
Love it when you say, I'm giving everything away, but
Tell me what's in it for me

Tell me now what's in it for me
No one's getting this for free
So tell me now what's in it for me
Whatever keeps you warm at night (whatever keeps you warm at night)

Whatever keeps you warm inside
Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down
Your bridges are burning now

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Gathering the ashes
Everything thrown away
Gathering the ashes
Scatter as they blow away

Your bridges are burning now
They're all coming down
It's all coming 'round

You're burning them down
It's all coming 'round
They're all coming down

Your bridges are burning now (Gather in the ashes)
They're all coming down (Everything thrown away)
It's all coming 'round (Scatter as they blow away)

You're burning them down (Gather in the ashes)
It's all coming 'round (Everything thrown away)
They're all coming down (Gather in the ashes)
Your bridges are burning now (Scatter as they blow away)


Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage I am Thank You a rat in a cage

(Mumbling tune)

Depite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
YA!


I have spent a lifetime
Waiting for the chance
To save you my confession
Save the one last dance
The same old superstition
Haunt us now and then
I'm begging for ignition
To start it all again

We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride

Breathe for me from now on
Breathe for me when I'm gone
Burn out beyond
Out beyond the sun

Will you still remember
There behind the skies
Walking on the embers
Standing in their light
The hardest part is knowing
Everything must die
The hardest part is waiting here
Waiting to collide

We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride
We'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight
We'll burn away
Burn away, burn away my pride

Breathe for me from now on
Breathe for me when I'm gone
Burn out beyond
Out beyond the sun

Burn on, burn on
Calling to you
Burn on, burn on
Calling to you
Burn on, burn on

I'll never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
We'll never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again
Never burn again


Where you off to with that head of yours
Is there somewhere you should be
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me, baby

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
You'll see

What you up to now your mirror's gone
Is there someone you should be
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you
But honestly
But honestly
But honestly

Don't take what I don't need
(Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
(Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me
No where to hide from me
You'll see

And tonight I thank the stars
As I count my lucky scars
For everything you've given me
And all the words I gave to you
Something borrowed something blue
If you want them back
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
Give it to you
Give it to you
I'll give it to you

I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
I don't want one thing that I gave to you


Where's this come from? he's just as
Where's this come from
He's just as dumb
As he denies

He never lies
Her new disguise
Is butterflies

I'm all sick for you
I'm not a fool
You're the one that bothers me
I am not a fool
You're the one pretending to be

I die for some
Rare pelicans
In wonderland

If she was true
She'd make them blue
Everytime (yeah it goes)

Where's this come from
He's just as dumb
As he denies


It was meant to be
But all along it never meant a thing
Never stopped to ask you why
You didn't pass me by
Did you see me in your life
Flash before your eyes
Was it just that I wasn't hard enough
Hard enough for you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there

Elementary
I solved them all
All your mysteries
Settle down and in good time
We can solve all mine
Tell me lies or tell me when
Tear me up again
And I will let you know
When I've had enough
Had enough of you

Stop using my
Confusion
Wait, wait
There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there

I know you've got your reasons
Hey let's call it even
Turn out all the lights and go to bed
Still I get this feeling
No one will believe me
When I let these ghosts outside my head

There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
Don't you deny me

There's a world out there
Don't you deny me
Give me one last wish
There's a world out there


Took the high dive into your brain
And you made your lonely calls
You just might wear your welcome out
If you don't let it go

There's nothing that you couldn't say
'Cause you've said it all before
I think it's time you walked this lonely road
All on your own

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

I wish I could take it away
And save you from yourself
You get so lost inside your head 
like no one else

Looking for someone to blame?
Did you blame me all along?
You'll take the heat
But you would never take the fall

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won

You're so afraid that you are the only one
that you are the only one
You know
Don't be afraid because you're not the only one
You're not the only one
I know

It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won
It's your cold day in the sun
Looks like your bleeding heart has already won


Seems like only yesterday
Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see
No looking back
Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Light began to fade
Into the black

Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly
Feel me anymore

Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything
Was said and done

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive

Still I tried to find my way
Spinning now was end of days
Burning like a flame
Behind my eyes

Drown it out
Drink it in
Crown the king of suffering
Prisoner, slave to the disguise

Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time
To say goodbye

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive
No reason left
Me to survive
You saved me
The day you came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day
You came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive

Nothing wrong to give
I can finally live
Come alive
Your life into me
I can finally breathe
Come alive

Lay me down in the dark
Open my eyes
You saved me
The day you came alive

Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive
Come alive


Tie up the transmission 
This one is not a test 
Silent all these years 
But now I'm getting you off my chest 
Reeling in the moment, 
I know it will never last 
Tired of keepin' quiet, 
Riding with all the rest 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you 
For you

Hide behind obsessions, 
I'm trying to keep in check 
Ride you for the finish 
We're coming?? 
Reeling in the moment 
I know it will never last 
Rise up to the surface 
High but I'm sinking fast 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback 
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you 

Stuck in the middle no-ones making a move 
I'm looking in and I've got nothing to lose 

I will comeback, 
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback
I will comeback, 
I will comeback for you


You lost your mind
I could not go
What little time we spent
A penny on the floor

My desperation
A spinning top
Revolving on and on
A world that never stops

Is it all mine?
How could I know?
We threw the rind away
Swallowed all the core

Tried levitation
You're not alone
The stars are holding open
A door we'll never close

I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful
The world will never know
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow

Is it all mine?
I can't let go
What little time we spent
A penny on the floor
My desparation
Is this a curse?
'Til death do us part
For better or for worse

I have an engine made of gold
Something so beautiful
The world will never know

Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow
Our roots are stronger than you know
Up through the concrete we will grow


Well, I met the seventh son
He came for everyone
The day he heard the lighting in the field
I heard him clear his throat
A fork within the road
That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel

I've been throwing knives
To see just where they land
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

The voice upon the stage
Is the heart inside a cage
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round
There's mystery in this wood
And ghosts within these roots
That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground

I've been going through life
Making foolish plans
Now my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

And you need blind faith
No false hope
Do you have blind faith?
No false hope
Where is your blind faith?
No false hope
Open your eyes, open your eyes
Step into the light
Open your eyes, step into the light
The sound becomes

Congregation
A congregation
A congregation, yeah
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round


Try Runnin around the candle
I was only running into you
Try Runnin around the candle
I don't try to run it into you

I get tired of runnin into you

Damn you damn everyone
I'll be fine without you
Damn you damn everyone
I'll be fine without you

I'm still tired of runnin into you

Try one that's with you
Tear my damn heart in two
I won't battle? at you
Running into it!  Running into it!


Danny says we gotta go 
Gotta go to Idaho, 
But we can't go surfing 
'cause its 20 below

Sound checks at 5 o' 2 
Record stores and interviews 
Oh but I can wait to be with you 
Tomorrow

Baby oh oh oh 
We got nowhere to go 
And it may seem funny 
But it's true uhu uhuu

Hanging out in 100 feet 
Watchin' get smart on TV 
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me

Hangin' out in here 
Having nowhere to go o 
I ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow 
Listening to Sheena on the radio

Danny says we gotta go 
Gotta go to Idaho 
But we can't go surfing 
Cause its 20 below

Baby oh oh oh 
We got nowhere to go 
And it may seem funny 
But it's true uhu uhuu

Hanging out in 100 feet 
Watchin' get smart on TV 
Thinkin' about you and me and you and me

Uh uh uh uh


I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine

She said how'd you like to waste some time 
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Ahh!
Nikki!
Oh

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho' 'nough sho' 'nough show you how to grind

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Ah!
Nikki!
Oh
Ah!
Come back Nikki! 
Come back!


Dear lover
Do you remember?
The sound of your laughter and demise
And that was all
I need to fall in love

This matter
It's something bigger
Anything ever graced my heart
And that was all
I could fall in love, with you
And I can't stall this now

Did you find some happiness with me?
Now I know the way true love should be

Dear lover
Do you remember?
The beats of my heart that I gave you
And that was all
I need to fall in love

It shattered
Slipped through my fingers
Floated down safely into your hands
And that was all
I could fall in love, with you
I can't stall this now

Ooh Ooh Ooh

Did you find some happiness with me?

Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea


You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me

I couldn't grow just living in the shadow
Where do you go when no one's following you?
You ran away, ran away it was right on cue

Shall I go on, and on, and on,
And on, and on, and on again?

Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary
Dear Rosemary

You've got a way, got a way, got a way with things
You got away, got away, got away with things

False starts, young hearts get shattered
Pick up the pieces coming down around you
You ran away, ran away, it was right on cue

Can I go on, and on, and on,
And on, and on, and on again?

Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary you're part of me
You know you are, you are, you are
Rosemary please pardon me

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

This was no ordinary life
(This was no ordinary life)
This was no ordinary life
(This was no ordinary life)

I'm here from now on
But once I'm gone
I'm gone

Truth ain't gonna change the way you lie
Youth ain't gonna change the way you die

Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)
You're a part of me (you're part of me)
Dear Rosemary (dear Rosemary)
Please pardon me (please pardon me)
Dear Rosemary

You got away, got away, got away from me
Now get away, get away, get away from me


I've been drinking dirty water
But I've been here before, after all
The witching hour is upon us
So you and I can sing haunted songs

In my dreams I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on
On and on

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms

You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row
I've been drinking dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold
All we know

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
I'm a natural disaster
And you're the morning after all my storms

Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water, breathe dirty sky

I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
Dirty water in my blood

I feel a moment coming on
Heavy metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms


Disenchanted Lullaby
Sing me yours, I'll sing you mine
Sing with me now what's a boy to do?
What's a boy to do?
Sing along for yesterday
Sing along my soul today
Sing along another song for you
What's a boy to do?

I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter
No one has a fit like I do

I may be scattered
A little shattered
What does it matter?
No one has a fit like I do
I'm the only one that's fits you

Whispering to pass the time
Whisper for the days gone by
Whisper with the voice inside of you
With this ring you will be mine
With this ring I'll multiply
With this ring surrendering to you
What's a boy to do?


Oh you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waiting and I wait at the longest night
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline

I was down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever 'cause nothing last
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

Finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

Ain't no way, DOA
Ain't no way, DOA

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, but have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

It's a shame we have to disappear
No ones getting out of here, alive

This time
This time
This time


You know in all of the time that we've shared
I've never been so scared
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there
I wish I never had taken this dare
I wasn't quite prepared
Doll me up in my bad luck
Uh huh, ah
Doll me up in my bad luck
I'll meet you there


Down in the park where the machmen meet
The machine and play kill by numbers
Down in the park with a friend called five
I was in a car crash or was it the war
But I never been quite the same
Little white lies like I was there

Come to tom-tom's the place to eat
Like it was built in one day
You can wath the humans trying to run
Oh look, there's a rape machine
I'd go outside if it'd look the other way
Wouldn't believe the things they do

Down in the park
Where the chant is death, death, death
Til' sun cries morning
Down in the park with friends of mine
We are not lovers, we are not romantics
We are here to serve
Different face but the words never change


Ooh look at me in a Cadillac
You can play in a convertible child
I've never been driven baby you're the first
come on baby drive me wild,  ooh

Ooh look at me on the telephone
whatever you want just dial
come on baby please it's so easy
do it baby drive me wild

come on baby do it drive me wild
do it baby drive me wild

Ooh look at me on the radio
call me up and make a request
If you want anything just name it
when I'm bad baby I'm the best

Ooh look at me on the big guitar
stick me up with a smile 
come on baby please it's so easy
do it baby drive me wild


Blast on mirror tell or said
Blast in weapon wear it all away
Empty handed, empty handed

Pillow to rest a little in the soul
Bread or stone into would

Empty handed

Never enough, never enough
Never enough yeah you had another rule
Never enough, never enough

Burn all the candles out
Make a wish but not aloud
Relive the here and now
See you now and then
I'm a revolvin' door
I've seen it all before
I will begin again
But I can't start until I've seen you end

I took a look around
I believe that in these eyes
The treasure's all we've found
May be more than needed
Now that we're old and worn
A little ripped and torn
One day we'll be reborn
One day I will meet you up again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling

I'm feelin' out of luck
Maybe I just feel too much
That old familiar touch
Always stained my skin
The good in everyone
The ties we left undone
The heart that meets your blood
All the things bring me 'round again
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
Oh yeah
Hey
Once again
Wait
Stop me so I can begin

End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]
I'm circling
End over end [Repeat x3]


I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lily
The best I've ever seen

Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be
Enough space

Hello
I've waited here for you
Everlong

Tonight I throw myself in two
Out of the red
Out of her head she sang

Come down and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head
Out of her head she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Breathe out
So I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now
I know you've always been
Out of your head
Out of my head I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

And I wonder
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when


I'm not around that much
Running exhausted and lost
If it could be undone
Will it have costed?
It's taught and lost

Blowing away we stray, wilted
Insuited, at fault
What if the day had stayed in bed
These baubles we've brought
At fault

After the bliss has long ended
This caution this fault
Give me a breeze that's long winded
Accosted adult arrested


Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong just hangin' on
Even though, watched you come and go
How was I to know you'd steal the show?
One day I'll have enough to gamble
I'll wait to hear your final call bet it all
Hangin' on here until I'm gone
Right where I belong, just hangin' on
Even though, pass this time alone
Somewhere so unknown, it heals the soul
You ask for walls, I'll build them higher
We'll lie in shadows of them all
I'd stand, but they're much to tall
And I fall
February stars re floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars
February stars floating in the dark
Temporary scars
February stars


Ready aim fire

No one fuckin' around standing in the line
You gotta feel it right between the eyes
Time is runnin' out, time to do it right, now

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie

Let yourself go, let me test your fate
Make your head roll, make your legs shake
Dance to the sound of heartache

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie, oh

Fat fucking lie, get on your bikes and ride

My oh my, every thing's gonna be fine
My oh my, fat fucking lie, fat fucking lie



He floats
Floats away
On the ground
He comes back down

She floats
Floats away
On the ground
She comes back down

They float
Float away
On the ground
They come back down

We float
Float away
On the ground
We come back down

That's not as big as
What's flown around here


I'm called a cow
I'm not about
To blow it now
For all the cows

It's funny how money allows all to browse
And be endowed
This wish is true it falls into pieces new
The cow is you

My kind has all run out, as if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows, everything worn in
Like it's a friend

I said you're all a painted doll and it caused
The walls to fall
How far is he? 
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be


I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I'll never be fraternity
I'll never need that brand of me
Fading the pace behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch you rise
Go on keep feeding 

Swearing by the 
Swearing father 
Swearing father

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

I don't believe fraternities
See the disease fraternities
Wait of the hate behind your eyes
Free to be straight for shape and size
Waiting awake and watch your rise
Go on keep feeding

Swearing by them 
Swearing father
Swearing father 

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Hand me down

I'll never be fraternity
Another disease fraternity
Never believe fraternity
Just armies bored in life

Bored in life
Bored in life


Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, yeah!

Beautiful prisoner, let it be dead
Promises made it certain to end
Voices and visions are locked in my head
I could sing for sorrow
All of the words that we damn never speak
All of our ghosts and secrets do keep
Gather them all we'll bury them deep
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me, hey!

One for forever
One in your name
Once in your member
We're one in the same
One to forget but it always remains
I could sing for sorrow

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Free me right now
You take me away, take it from me
Could you free what's keepin' you?
Well I need somebody too

Free me! Free me!
Free me! Free me!
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, yeah!


He needs a quiet room
With a lock to keep him
In its just a quiet room
And he's there
He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar
That he played
Hm mm mm

He's never been in love
But he knows just what love is
He says never mind
And no one speaks

He thinks he drinks too much
Cause when he tells his two best friends
I think I drink too much

No one speaks
No one speaks
No one speaks
Hm hm mm mm mm hm hm mm

He plays an old guitar
With a coin found by the phone
It was his friends guitar

That he played
When he plays
No one speaks
No one speaks
And he plays
No one speaks


Gas chamber there's a light. 
Stay at home don't feel right. 
In my room all the time 
Trapped inside this twisted mind. 
Gas chamber cannot breathe. 
Time for lunch cannot leave. 

In my room all the time 
Trapped inside this fucking mind. 
No action no no 
No action gas chamber 
Oh no 
No action


Lately I'm getting better
Wish I could stay sick with you
But there's too many egos left to bruise
Call it sin
You can call it whatever
Eating deep inside of you
Well if it were me it's all I'd ever do

Steal me now and forever
I'll steal something good for you
The criminal in me is no-one new

Till you find something better
When there's nothing left to use
And everything starts going down on you

I'm the generator
Firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it

Send me out on a tether
Swing it round
I'll spin your noose
You let it down
I'll hang around with you
Till you find someone better
When there's no-one left to lose
Everyone keeps going down

I'm the generator
Firing whenever you quit
Yeah, whatever it is
You go out and it's on
Yeah can't you hear my motored heart
You're the one that started it


I can be your right of way
So we can get out of here
I've always been the one
Who runs from everyone
Cos everyone's just too weird

Sink with someone tied to me
I'm making you volunteer
Another one has come and gone
They crawl along
Make them disappear

Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you

Take another stab at me
I promise in time I'll heal
But yesterday went on and on a bit too long
I waited out on high street
There's nothing to find out here
Another day has come and gone
They crawl along
Wasting all these years

Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dress me up in stitches
It's now or never
Tired of wearing black and blue
Dying to get my blood on you
Blood on you

How can you go on
When you're murdering someone
Killing me like you do

Gimme stitches
Now or never

Before I get my blood on you


Since I'm putting down all of the true things around, but I like it
I handed down the crown, given the jewels and the answers of may
The thought of being ousted comes and goes
When I think about it the wind blows
I hate it

Run me out of town, somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels, always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways, gull and noun
Chills and petty band-aids, wrapped around
I hate it

Good grief


Say a prayer for me, in my memory.
Have a taste, another one is through.

Damn this place in me, damn this destiny.
I will be the one who cries when you go.

Hello misery, you're the best of me.
Hey, somone got the best of you.

Come and sleep with me for infinity.
We'll spend some time and find the rest of you.

Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Rain down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe

Pray for me, fading memories.
Give me time and i will fade into you.

Come and dance with me, i will always be
Sleeping behind the eyes that i'm bleeding through.

Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe

Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe

Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead

Break down
Break down
Reeling in your head
Rain down
Way down
Innocence is dead

Goodbye lament
Goodbye lament
Goodbye faith, I swear I won't believe


Good and bad 
I swear I've had them both, they're overrated 
But is it fun 
When you get hold of one 
Some gone bad 
And some gone back 
Good ones all get taken I'm callin' bluff 
You ain't strong enough

Wait and pray you'll pick on me 
the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 

Say your prayers when you get scared 
Pray you're gonna make it 
And then when you're done 
You keep fucking up 
One day soon I'll disappear 
And if you'll come I'll take you somewhere to go 
To keep from growing old 

Wait and pray you'll pick on me 
the day I raise my hand 
Guess that I've been nice but I'll be damned 

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Oh, oh, oh

Disappear, the light is fading 
Disappear, outside their rage 
Disappear, I'm tired of waiting 
Disappear before we get away

Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 
Halo 
God only knows 
Right behind me everywhere I go 
oh, oh oh


The sun went down on another perfect day
Busy counting shadows on the wall
The weeds are swallowing up the flower bed
Roses in the whiskey jar
Blood on the thorns
Drink until the taste is gone

Cracks in the floorboards are deep
From dancing to the sound of candles burning out
Heavy from writing your resignations
Licking bitter envelopes
Blood on your tongue
Drink until the taste is gone

Where is your Shangri la now?
Where is your Shangri la now?
Counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

Where is your Shangri la now? (where's your Shangri la?)
Where is your Shangri la now? (where's your Shangri la?)
Counting down to zero hour
There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour

There ain't no superheroes now
There ain't no superheroes, they're underground
Happy ever after
Counting down to zero hour


Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar. 
You're gonna go far, 
You're gonna fly high, 
You're never gonna die, 
You're gonna make it if you try, 
They're gonna love you. 

Well I've always had a deep respect, 
And I mean that most sincerely. 
The band is just fantastic, 
That is really what I think. 
Oh by the way, which one's Pink? 

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, 
We call it Riding the Gravy Train. 

We're just knocked out. 
We heard about the sell out. 
You gotta get an album out. 
You owe it to the people. 
We're so happy we can hardly count. 

Everyone else is just green, 
Have you seen the chart? 
It's a helluva start, 
It could be made into a monster 
If we all pull together as a team. 

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy, 
We call it Riding the Gravy Train.


You're my size I need to try you on 
Someone in between the right and wrong 
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Through everything you stayed that same old heart 
And when I've had enough 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
Go on and have it all. 

Running through this maze you hold me in
Searching all these days to find the end 
Your everything, your everything I'm not
But I'm anything, I'm anyone you want 
And when I've had enough 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me
Go on and have it all
Have it all
Have it all

Your everything you're everything I'm not 
I'm anything I'm anyone you want 

She drains me 
When I'm empty 
She fills herself 
She takes it all 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep  
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 
In too deep 
She's spilling over me 

Have it all


Have you been headwired?
Were you satisfied?
Did it free the feelings in your spine?
Sleeping way inside all this time

Will your meet your mind
Where the night collides?
Will you greet yourself
When the sun arrives?

I'll just stay behind
I've met mine

Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now    

Help you feed the wires
When your head unwinds?
And if our headlines become entwined
You can have all mine
I'll be fine

There's a reason why
Keeping me alive
There's a cure in me
That I wish were mine
As long as I can fight, I'll survive

Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now
Better than a bullet being fired  
Tangled in your headwires now

Stationed on the wire
One day I'll let go
Tell them all 'Hello'
Tell them all 'Hello'

The sun is on
Arlandria

Headwires


This state I'm in
A place I've never been
I'm dying to meet you here

Come break this skin
I'll let you sink right in
And show you everything
See you in hell
See you in hell

We'll gather around the fire
And I will lead the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell

Come break, my spell
Well down the wishing well
We'll find some time to kill

I'll be, right there
The buzz inside your head
The whole electric chair
See you in hell

We'll gather round the fire
And I don't need the choir
Sing farewell
See you in hell


Blew it all away
Blew it all away
Living green and gray
Blew it all away

Read to pass the time
Sappy old brick line
Turns to yours and mine
Read to pass the time

You and I in hell's garden, hell's garden
The way it used to work
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Pray to wash the burn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to burn

Blew it all away
Blew it all away
Living green and gray
Blew it all away

You and I in hell's garden, hell's garden
The way it used to work
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Pray to wash the burn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to the world
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Wait another turn
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Can't pray another word
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Will to the world
I'm in hell's garden, hell's garden
Can't pray another word

Come and I'll take you under
This beautiful bruises colors
Everything fades in time, it's true

Wish that I had another
Stab at the under cover
Was it a change in mind for you?

It's impossible
I can't let it out
You'll never know
Am I selling you out?
Sit and watch
Your every mood

Your eyes still remind me of
Angels that hover above
Eyes that can change from blind to blue

Now that I've found my reward
Throw it away long before
I'd share a piece of mine with you


Wish I were with you, but I couldn't stay
Every direction leads me away
Pray for tomorrow, but for today
All I want, is to be home

Stand in the mirror, you look the same
Just looking for shelter, from the cold and the pain
Someone to cover, safe from the rain
And all I want, is to be home

The echoes and silence, patience and grace
And all of these moments I'll never replace
Fear of my heart absence of faith
All I want, is to be home

All I want, is to be home

People I've loved, have no regrets
Some might remember, some might forget
Some of them livin', some of them dead
All I want, is to be home


We sat and watched a new day melt 'til dawn.
Had my share of memories now it's time to move on.
Another lonely lesson never turned out wrong.
These things I've done without you - should have never been done.
Call on me and I'll shout down.

How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?

I've never felt this wrong and now I know.
This love was burning through me though it never did show.
Let's spend tonight together kissing stars below.
We'll hide inside each other - never let you go.
Call on me and I'll shout down.

How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?

(guitar solo)

Call on me and I'll shout down.

How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?
How do you do when I'm not around?


How i miss you
How i miss you
How i miss you
I should never call
How i hope that you still miss me

Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Did I lose you?
Somewhere down the line
Hide 
seeks alright if i find

Do you miss me
Like i miss you
If you miss me,
Never go away
Hopefully, you'll come stay someday

If you're leaving,
come back soon
Thats not easy to say

I'll wait here,
dream of you
all alone as i ache


There is a secret
I found a secret
Behind a Soho door

There is a reason
I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor

I found the water
The devils water
And walked along its shore

Is that what you want?

The channel's changing
The heart is racing
From voices on a wire

The soul is yearning
The cold is burning
The ember starts a fire

Can we recover
Love for each other
The measure of your life

Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want

A river
A river
A river running under ground

A river
A river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I! I! I am a river

Is that what you want
Is that what you really want

I! I! I am a river

I am a river!

I! I! I am a river


Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp

Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp

Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp
I feel free

Feel when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free
I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

I, I, I, I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I can walk down the street, there's no one there
Though the pavements are one huge crowd
I can drive down the road; my eyes don't see
Though my mind wants to cry out loud
Though my mind wants to cry out loud

Dance floor is like the sea
Ceiling is the sky
You're the sun and as you shine on me

I feel free
I feel free
I feel free

I, I, I, I


I should have known that it would end this way
I should have known there was no other way
Didn't hear your warning
Damn my heart gone deaf

I should have known, look at the shape you're in
I should have known, but I dove right in
One thing is for certain
As I'm standing here
I should have known

Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt

I should have known, I was inside of you
I should have known, there was that side of you
Came without a warning
Caught me unaware
I should have known, I've been here before
I should have known, don't want it anymore
One thing is for certain
I'm still standing here
I should have known

Lay your hands in mine
Heal me one last time
Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
I should have known

Maybe you was right
Didn't want a fight
I should have known
Couldn't read the signs
Couldn't see the light
I should have known

Though I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave my heart in debt
No, I cannot forgive you yet
No, I cannot forgive you yet
You leave us all in debt
I should have known


I thought I knew all it took to bother you
Every word I said was true that you'll see

How could it be I'm the only one who sees your rehearsed insanity

I still refuse all the methods you've abused
It's all right if you're confused let me be

I've been around all the pawns
You've gagged and bound
They'll come back and knock you down and I'll be free

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I had no other hand in your ever desperate plan
It returns and when it lands words are due

I should've known we were better off alone
I looked in and I was shown
You were too

I've taken all and I've endured
One day it all will fade
I'm sure

I don't owe you anything

I'll stick around and learn from all that came from it


All the things I said I wanted
Turned out to be heaven haunted
Everytime I dream I'm sharing
All the things that I tried pairing too

If the thought could ever barter
Time enough to make a pedal
Now I might help any other
Now that's it, I'll simply ponder you

It's hard to recognize that's all
True it wasn't that at all

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along

All the things I said I wanted
Turned out to be heaven haunted
Everytime I dream I'm sharing
All the things that I tried pairing too

If the thought could ever barter

Now I might help any other
Now thats it, I'll simply ponder you

Its hard to recognize that's all
True it wasn't that at all

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along

(guitar solo)

Its hard to recognize that's all
True it wasn't that at all

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again
Never thought I'd see the one I told you
Head is along
Over now

I'm alone again


I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a bar
Sitting in a corner in imperfect clothes
Trying not to pose
For the cameras and the girls
It's a glamorous world

I'm in love with a German film star
I once saw in a movie
Playing the part of a real troublemaker
But I didn't care
It really moved me, it really moved me

If ever you think you're not the one
I'll remind you
If ever you think you're 'bout to run
I will follow you

Come on to me
Just let it go
If ever you think you're not the one
I'll remind you

Come on my love
Come on my love

I'll remind you
With everything under the sun
Stars above you

There are days I might not make it
There are days I might start brakin'
When the rain starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spear
It's in the square god damn I swear

There are times I feel like givin' in
There are times I begin to begin again
Look outside the world keeps spinning like a paddle wheel
Rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the heel

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

In the clear

There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember
How could I forget you painted stars into the sky
Coming like a reaper marching in the second life

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

In the clear

And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out!

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

You know I'm not in the clear
You are not in the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear

In the clear


Can you hear me
Hear me screamin'
Breaking in the muted skies
This thunder heart
Like bombs beating
Echoing a thousand miles

Mine is yours and yours is mine
There is no divide
In your honor
I would die tonight

Mine is yours and yours is mine
I will sacrifice
In your honor
I would die tonight
For you to feel alive

Can you feel me
Feel me breathing
One last breathe before I close my eyes
This suffering
For receiving
Deliver me into the other side

For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
For you to feel alive
Ahh


Made the sinners cry
He oped up his sky
The rivers ran with blood
The deserts name was love

Said who can not be saved
Soul of a man is much depraved
Don't act as if you are his clone
Made of iron and of stone

Justice swept the land
To raise the mortal man
And when he overcome
The war has just begun

As the darkness spreads across his land
Soul of man who stays his hand
Forms the basis of his home
Made of iron and of stone

When it came the time
To confess his crime
The people stood and stared
And didn't even care

And the morning had died
The millions knew that there was no lie
Temple was built and the worshiping showed
Made of iron and of stone


Have you ever been dumb enough to do what you wanted to do
Without good reason coming over you?
Have you ever been young enough to feel what you wanted to feel?
Take back those years for something real

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Have you ever been drunk enough to say what you wanted to say
Without no words getting in the way?
Have you ever been in love enough to be who you wanted to be?
I won't mind you if you won't mind me

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
Held against my will

Can you believe we're older?
I won't believe it's over now
Do you remember being children?
Do you remember when? Now

I'm an iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Cold and still
Irregular sculpture
An iron rooster
Held against my will


Keep it clean
My momma said keep it clean
Keep it clean
My momma said keep it clean

Drivin' all night
Gotta hankerin' for somethin'
Think I'm in the mood for some hot man muffins
Mmmm, sounds so fine
Yes indeed

Keep it clean
My daddy said keep it clean
Keep it clean
My daddy said keep it clean

Aint lookin' for a fight
Aint lookin' for trouble
Howdy Mr. Right
Have you met Mr. Bubble?
Hey, putter there
Aint she sweet?

Rubbin' and a-lovin' and a-scrubbin' and a-truckin'
Maybe if we're lucky, just a little bear huggin'
Know what I mean
Keep it clean
(x3)


Every night my dream?s the same
Same old city with a different name
They?re not coming to take me away!
I don?t know why, but I know I can?t stay
Yeah

There?s a weight that?s pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don?t know where and they don?t know when

It?s coming
When it?s coming

There?s a weight that?s pressing me down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don?t know where and they don?t know when

It?s coming
Or when
But it?s coming, keep the car running

There?s this fear I keep so deep
Knew it's name since before I can speak, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

They know my name I know them
Can?t swim across a river so deep
They know my name but I don't understand
But they don?t know where, they don?t know when

It?s coming
Or when
Keeps me coming, keep the car running

Keep the car running

Keep the car running



Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone, and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat, but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town

Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody live for the music-go-round

Bright lights, the music, gets faster
Look, boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is 

Downtown the young ones are going
Downtown the young ones are growing
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody listen for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a

Come closer, honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh, don't try to stop, baby, hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburbia's sprawling everywhere
I don't want to go, baby

New York to East California
There's a new wave coming, I warn ya
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
We're the kids in America (Whoa)
Everybody listen for the music-go-round

La la la la-la la-a

We're the kids, we're the kids 
We're the kids in America...

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
Fuck it


It gets lonliest at night
Down at the liquor store
Beneath the neon sky
Our moonlight
Six a.m. the floor comes alive with lice
The pan's dried up so tight
With hardened beans
We're hungry
So I lean on you sometimes
Just to see you're still there
Your feet can't take the weight of one
Much less two
We hit concrete
How were we born into this mess?
I know I painted you a prettier picture, baby
But we were run out on a rail
Fell from the wagon to the night train

I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissing you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two

Cigarettes they fill the gaps
In our empty days
In our broken teeth
We're jonesing
Say mister, can you spare a dime?
Some change could make a change
Could buy some time
Some freedom
Or an ear to hear my story
It's all I've got
My fiction beats the hell out of my truth
A palm upturned burnt blue
Don't call it sunburn
You've been shaking on the job
Just one drink ahead of your past
There's a white light coming up
You draw the blinds hoping it'll pass

I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissin you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two

I kissed the bottle
I should've been kissin you
You wake up to an empty night
With tears for two
Tears for two


Look out 'cause you know what you're doing
Turn up the American ruse

Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me
Get things right

Hook me up a new revolution
'Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing
And watch the last one die

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)

Think I'm done nursing the patience
I can wait one night
I'd give it all away
If you give me one last try

We live happily ever trapped
If you just save my life
Run and tell the angels
That everything is all right

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly (high)
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly

Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me
I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to

Looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly high
Make my way back home
When I learn to fly
Make my way back home

A heart of gold
But it lost it's pride
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
I see your face
In another light

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

A simple man
And his blushing bride
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Intravenous
Intertwined
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)
Hearts gone cold
Your hands were tied
(Why'd you have to go)
(And let it die)

Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
In too deep
And out of time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let it die

Do you ever think of me
You're so considerate
Did you ever think of me
Oh so considerate

In too deep
And lost in time
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Beautiful veins
And bloodshot eyes
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Hearts gone cold
And hands are tied
Why'd you have to go
And let it die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go
And let this die
Why'd you have to go

Why'd you have to go

Sometimes I can't help the feeling that, 
I'm living a life of illusion
And oh, why can't we let it be
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion
I just can't help the feeling
I'm living a life of illusion

Pow! Right between the eyes
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises
Wow, it all seems so logical now
It's just one of her better disguises
And it comes with no warning
Nature loves her little surprises
Continual crisis

Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day
Caught up in endless solutions
That have no meaning, just another hunch
Based upon jumping conclusions
Endless solutions
Backed up against a wall of confusion

I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion
I'm living a life of illusion


I knew a girl named Nicky 
I guess you could say 
She was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel loby
Masterbatin' with a magazine
She said,
'How'd you like to waste some time?'
And I could not resist 
When I saw little Nicky grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said,
'Sign ur name on the dotted line.'
The lights went out
And Nicky started to grind

(Wooah Nicky!!!)

The castle started spinning 
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But me body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
She'll show you no mercy
But she'll show nuff - 
Show nuff, show ya how to grind

Woke up the next mornin'
Nicky wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said,
'Thank you for a funky time.
Call me up whenever you wanna grind'

(Wooah Nicky!!!) 
(Come back Nicky, Come back!!!)



Take your payroll
And your lottery
There's a place I know
There's a robbery

And I swear I'll never tell
If you swear you'll never tell
And we'll all make out so well
We will all make out so well

Head on with my hate
Into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted

Just the same old
Glitter story
From the sea floor
Metamorphosis
And I can't change back for you
I will not change back for you
I must live in skin that's new
I'm a livid skin that's new

Head on with my hate
Into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted

Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again
Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again

I'm amounted

And I can't change back for you
No I can't change back for you


What would I do?
Lonely as you
Pleasure or pain I can choose
What would I do?
Lonely as you

Pleasure or pain I can choose

Wake up your dream and I can't stand your screamin'
Drowning out these prayers just some words without meanin'
Spare all the preachin' my secret's worth keepin'
No one understands like I do

Keep out of reach I'm your leadin' deletion

One more time for release

Blame all the children their rage and their ruin
Blame it on the black and the blue

Hey now don't make a sound
Say have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in it's place

A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singing in your name

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh God I've sealed my fate
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turning back, don't turn that page

Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay
Running through hell
Heaven can wait

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead ends

Long road to ruin
There in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow
No dead-end in sight


You make me weep and want to die
Just when you said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

When I'm alone all by myself
You're out with someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other

You're tearing me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh, what can I say?
You're tearing me apart

It won't be long, yes, until you're alone
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home
Because he's lovin', oh, he's touchin'
He's squeezin' another

He's tearing you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh girl, what can you say?
Because he's lovin', touchin' another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na


Hey you
Are you in there
I'm stuck outside you, ooh
We could use
One another
Another like you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you, ooh

Me and you
Going nowhere
I'm right beside you, ooh
Me and you
Going nowhere I'm right beside you, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
Screws inside
Turn so tight
Turning on you
I'm hanging on you

Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
Low as you go
Ooh, ooh

Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
As low as you go
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)
Taking you as low as you go
(Low as you go)
As low as you go
(Low as you go)


Calling on the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand

She believes in everything
In everyone and you and yours and mine
I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind

Heyyyyy Lyla
The star's about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so '
Smallll Lyla
If you can hear me call and I can '
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven can I help you catch me if I ' fall

She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven held my memories still
She ring the bell for all the world to hear

Heyyyyy Lyla
The star's about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so '
Smallll Lyla
If you can hear me call and then I can '
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I ' fall

Heyyyyy Lyla
The star's about to fall -
So what you sayyyy Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so '
Smallll Lyla
But you can hear me call and I can '
Sayyyy Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I ' fall


Call and I'll answer
At home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taken pleasure
In breaking down

Never mind the mannequins
Drunk in their hollow town
Drinking their spoils down
Cheap imitations
A revelation is now

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Counting every minute
Till the feeling comes crashing down
Run when it hits the ground
I'm good at escaping,
But better at flaking out

Calling unanswered
The center becomes blown out
Stuck in the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing
I never could face you down

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Red, red, laced around your head
Cold and rescued

Call and I'll answer
At home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taken pleasure
In breaking down

Yeah, you won't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
So you don't find me
I'm going M.I.A.
Tonight I'm leaving
Going M.I.A.
Say goodbye to me
I'm going M.I.A.
I can find relief
I'm going M.I.A.
Getting lost in you again
Is better than being numb

Better than playing dumb


I'm hanging around
I'm not putting down the state i'm in
I've never been proud
And now I'm allowed to shed my skin

I'm driving away
I know if I stay, I'll sit and spin
Imagine the day
I'm drowning at bay, so reel me in

Pick up where I left off

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose with you

I see it all now
I'm taking my bow and everything
I'm scratching around
It's getting too loud, the space I'm in

So now I can leave
10 pieces at least, some evidence
The one that relieves
The other's disease like minicyn

Pick up where I left off

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose

Speaking in tongues
I can't get through
Thinking of running but
I'm tired of running into you

Speaking in tongues, the way I do
I've found that you understand quite well
Cause that's your language too

I'm hanging around
I'm not putting down the state I'm in
In love with the sound
It's getting too loud.

Let's make a bet
We'll make a bargain and call this truce
Let's make a bet
I'm at loss and win or lose

Let's make a bet
I never wanted to call this truce
Let's make a bet
All is lost and win or lose with you


Everybody needs, everybody needs
Needs a little suffer
I just wanna do, I just wanna do
Do a little number
Bite the hand that feeds, bite the hand that feeds
Bite a little harder
What's it gonna take, what's it gonna take
Gonna take a lover

Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinning
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?

Everybody breathe, everybody breathe
Breathe a little deeper
Got no soul to keep, got no soul to keep
Ain't no brother's keeper
I don't fuckin' need, I don't fuckin' need
I don't need a matyr
Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?
Gonna be another

Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinning
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right

Hop on the train to nowhere baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinning
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right
Gonna make it right


He's there in case I wandered off
He's scared because I warned
He's scared in case I want it all
He's scared 'cause I want

All in all the clock is slow
Six color pictures all in a row
Of a marigold


if I share powdered milk with you
I glue a picture to the chair
spit and butter from the plate
that broke a week ago

Gather Round

a father scolds his little boy
for trading secrets with a girl
he turns and kicks the neighbors dog
into the other yard

Gather Round

for Marys homeless people in the cardboard
church beneath the ramp fire
is left for anyone to blame until.....

Gather Round


Crazy but I believe this time
Begging for sweet relief
A blessing in disguise
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep
Please come to me tonight

Hands on a miracle
I've got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
That you'd it away

Everything that we survived
It's gonna be alright
Just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searching every where
You're right here in my sight

Hands on a miracle
I've got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away

Hands on a miracle
I've got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
I've got my hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way 
Let you take it away
Take it away


If I had my way
If I had to lose
Wouldn't take back one thing, never had much to choose
Then it dawned on me
Coming down on you
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon

You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to explain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's go
Go

What a nice long leash
What a nice tight noose
Never worked for me but sure look good on you
You've waited all your life
Your wish is coming true
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you

Miss the misery
Need a reason for a change
Need a reason to refrain
So turn it on again
Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Get in and let's go
Go

Miss the misery
Gimme a reason for a change
Miss the misery
Gimme a reason to refrain
Miss your misery in a day
Miss your misery in a day
Come on and turn it on for me

Don't change your mind
Your wasting light
Don't make this right
Don't make this right
Get in and let's go
Go


What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench
Temper One last thing before I quit!
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head!
I still remember every single word you said,
And all the shit that somehow came along with it!
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this

I'll never be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
Don't wanna be your monkey wrench


I can't wait til it's light out
There's some things, I should get them done
Tried inhaling some white out
Ended up with some bleeding gums

Anything I left in the closet
Shouldn't have a hard time getting out
If I had the time I could make it
Seems to me the chances are chasing

All the substance I've done without
And all the luck that I've hated
Aside from all of the petty doubt
Can't believe I have made it

I'm afraid of the dark now
That's the sign of a patsy
Round the time of the door brow
You should let it come in

Never put your face in the water
It hurts your eyes when they open up
Not that any different could matter
It's just a different conspirit

If there's one thing I could laugh about
It's all this mess I've created
I've tried the part of the sacred cow

Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain

(guitar solo)

If there's one thing I could laugh about
And solve this mess I've created
I've tried the part of the sacred cow
I can't believe that i waited

Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you
Mountain of you


Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Kudos, my hero, leavin' all the best
You know my hero, the one that's on
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary


Real life is so hard
We hide in the stars
That's where our heads are
My head and your heart

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate

When you are so far
I'm falling part
Lose all my sonar
You jam my radar

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate

Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck
Between the handshake and the fuck
You've got me on guard
I've got my head start
My head and your heart
The same in the stars

This is a blackout
Don't let it go to waste
This is a blackout
I want to detonate

Sometimes I feel I'm getting stuck
Between the handshake and the fuck
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Okay


There are things that I'd like to say.
But I'm never talking to you again.
Things I'd like to phrase some way.
But I'm never talking to you again.

Never talking to you again.
Never talking to you.
I'm tired of wasting all my time.
Trying to talk to you.

I'd put you down where you belong.
But I'm never talking to you again.
Show you everyway you're wrong.
I'm never talking to you again.

Never talking to you again.
Never talking to you.
I'm tired of wasting all my time.
Trying to talk to you, talking to you.

I'm never talking to you again.
Never talking to you.
I'm tired of wasting all my time.
Trying to talk to you.


Have you found your way around the down and out?
I know it must seem long, so long
I'm still trying' to keep this time from runnin' out
Head down, always movin' on and on and on
I never heard this warnin'

Another early mornin' takes me, wakes me into
If you could manage me, I'll try to manage you
But lately it's all I ever do
I felt like this on my way home

I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I know these things must bore you
I can't find another way
I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holdin'
I love this leash that holds me
When I try to run away

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared,
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared

I felt like this on my way home
I'm not scared
I pass boats and the Kingdome
I'm not scared


I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the wide world riot
And hiding out
I'll be coming home next year

Into the sun we climb
Climbing our wings will burn white
Everyone strapped in tight
We'll ride it out
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till life runs out
No-one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

Into the night we shine
Lighting the way we glide by
Catch me if I get too high
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

I'm in the sky tonight
There I can keep by your side
Watching the whole world wind
Around and round
I'll be coming home next year

Come on, get on, get on
Take it till I fall down
No one can find us now
Living with our heads underground

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's all right up here
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye

I'll be coming home next year
I'll be coming home next year
Everything's all right up here
When I come down
I'll be coming home next year


Lately, I've been
Livin' in my head
The rest of me is dead 
I'm dying for truth

Make me, believe
No more left and right
Come on take my side
I'm fightin' for you
I'm fightin' for you

Pleased to meet you take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from here

Wake me, I'm ready
Somethin' don't seem right
I was dreamin' and I was talkin' to you

Memory, mend me
Know I've seen my share
Things I can't repair
I'm breakin' to you
I'm breakin' to you

Pleased to meet you take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from, here

Pleased to meet you take my hand
There is no way back from here
Pleased to meet you say your prayers
There is no way back from here
But I don't care
No way back from, here, yeah


The waves that silences break come again,
One by one
I lay awake and I count til I drown
Turn off the room, it's getting too loud, 
I know I don't have to say it,
Pick up and move and go find some new ground,
Somewhere I know I can make it

But I won't give up,
When I want it enough,
No I won't give up,
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
'Cause I've figured it out,
Here and the now, 
Takes me day by day

Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make eveything right,
Make me normal, from now on

Erased every one I've replaced
In the end, they're all gone,
The faces all fade as the time passes by
What could I do I was waiting for you,
Grown sick and tired of faking,
Give me those eyes when I give you the truth,
Finally here for the taking

But I won't give up,
When I want it enough,
No I won't give up,
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday
Cause I've figured it out,
Here and the now, 
Takes me day by day

[Repeat: x2]
Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make eveything right,
Make me normal, from now on 

Figured it out,
Here and the now,
Takes me day by day

[Repeat: x2]
Hey, will you come out tonight?
Will you back down will you put up a fight?
Turn me around and make everything right,
Make me normal, from now on 

Make me normal, from now on
Make me normal, from now on
Make me normal, from now on


The train that I got onto up and left that town
Threw it up as it went down
Strange enough it left me rude and turned around
Watched as they all took their vows

Fools were drawing trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway

Phase it out until the older ones return
Have a seat and watch it burn
Trace around the corner this is what I've learned
Always waited for my turn


One more day that I've survived
Another night alone
Pay no mind I'm doing fine
I'm breathing on my own

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Wake me when the hour arrives
Wake me with my name
See you somewhere down the line
We're tethered once again

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go

Close and stay a while
To take me where you go
Single file we walk the mile
Who's wandering back home

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

I'm here
And I'm on the mend
I'm here
And I'm on the mend my friend

Was it you?
Sat alone
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go


Oh misery come marshal me in,
No better place for me to begin.
I'm coming in from out of this rain,
The time has come to wash you away.

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.

Oh bring to me your broken and blue,
No matter if it matters to you.
A longing like never before,
Ive had enough now i need more.

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
Oh gather round sing those sins, amen.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come once and for all
My time has come this means war.

Hey. Forgive me debility,
I'll sing you all my sins.

My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.
My time has come once and for all,
My time has come, this means war.

My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war

The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again
The lovers are riding again


There you are dancing at your altar
Beautiful earthling, dressed in Kashmir
All of your sound echoes in the canyons
Down below they're dreaming
Hear the sirens screaming
Another time, another world
Girls were boys and boys were girls
Find the glitter in the litter
Like a haunt, it's got to move
Everybody needs some room
There's something out there

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

Oh, I found the space between the spaces
Standing in the nothing, and time will cling to
And as the wind will beat you down
And the wind the only sound
There's something out there

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me

There's a long straight road, out of the cold
And we can leave it all behind
I wanna get outside, baby, let's get outside
I wanna get outside, outside, of me


Restless little one
Comfortable and warm
Let me fall apart
Crippled in your arms

Chase me through the dark
Ready on your mark
First to reach the stars
Wins a broken heart
One that broke apart
Shattered from the start

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon

Could I be the one
To break a will so strong
Pray it won't be long
Til your will is gone
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out
Over and out

Cages and alarms
Keeping us from harm
I will be the guard
Hope to rest upon
Everything is done
Nothing left at all

Are you there?
Do you read me?
Are you there?
I don't feel you anymore

Are you there?
Will you give in?
Are you there?
If I give out


Coming down I'm coming round
this time I think I'm waking up
Give me loud to drown it out
before the world starts breaking up
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Yours and mine and left and right
there's still two sides to everyone
You and I get on with life
and pray we'll find a better one
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers on the mend

Hurry now we're getting out
this time there's nothing stopping us
Leave behind this vacant town
tonight and let it turn to rust
You change and then you change again
Turning like a wheel inside your head

Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Overdrive we're going life or death
Two strangers, no relation, on the mend

Ozone, ozone, ozone, ozone 

Now I'm the kinda guy who 
likes getting high 
Getting high and dry, and 
I do it all the time 
If you think it's a crime and 
you don't wanna try 
Something that'll make you high, 
then I think I'll say goodbye 

'Cos I'm the kind of guy who likes 
getting high 
Getting high and dry, and 
I do it all the time 
Now I'm much too high, I am 
high and dry 
And I'm feelin' fine, I'm feelin' 
good all of the time... (to fade)


Ahhhahhahhahh 
She came from Planet Claire
I knew she came from there
She drove a Plymouth Satellite
Faster than the speed of light 
Planet Claire has pink air
All the trees are red
No one ever dies there
No one has a head 
Ahhhahhhahhahh 
Some say she's from Mars
Or one of the seven stars
That shine after 3:30 in the morning
Well she isn't 
Ahhhahhhahhahhahhahh



Power is as sacred to  that they never even teach
Only if it's black or white see the challenges
Open eyes are broken if you'd just consider me
Cut you loose, I feel like I gotta gotta go!

Find an answer help yourself
Find an answer help yourself

Whatever kind of phony body chewed it through the night
Soda is left to block away the case of broken heart
Spit out fast for fun for it's the only way to win
Take my breathe come back inside, oh I gotta gotta go!

I got the answer help yourself
Find any answer help yourself
Help yourself, help yourself, help yourself


[Instrumental]


Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know I need to know tonight

Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razor blade shine

Patience my dear
We could spend a lifetime waiting here
Maybe this time
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye

Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razor of mine

Day after day
Cutting away
Day after day
But anyway

Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know I need to know tonight

Sweet and divine
Razor blade shine


Man watchin' video
The heart keeps on tickin'
He doesn't know why
He's just cattle for slaughter

The requiem

When the meaningful words
When they cease to function
When there's nothing to say
When will they start plotting against you

Only a hint of religion
I'm sensing spirits of depravity
The sound of breaking glass
This is the reflection


Something that I felt today, something that I had
Swingin' from the chandeliers, hanging on your word
I remember watchin' you once upon a time
Dancing from across the room in another life

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

Lookin' back to find my way, never seemed so hard
Yesterday's belated rest, changing of the gods
I would never change a thing even if I could
All the songs we used to sing, everything was good

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you
One more tear that you won't hear
That's gone and passed you by
Happened to you, happened to you

A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how
A little bit of resolve is what I need now
Pin me down, show me how

A little bit of resolve
One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)
A little bit of resolve
One more year that you're not here
It's gone and passed you by (a little bit of resolve)


This indecision got me climbing up the wall
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall
How did this come over me, I thought I was above it all
Our hopes gone up in smoke, swallow your crown

Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,
I, go, noose

These premonitions got me crying up a storm
Leave your condition, this position does no harm

Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you
Choke, on a kiss, I thought I'd save my breath for you

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some rope I'm coming, out of my head, into the clear when you, go,
I, go, noose

Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm hanging on you
Give me some rope I'm coming loose, I'm pulling for you now
Give me some hope I'm coming through, I'm coming out, yeah
Give me some rope, I'm coming out of my head, into the clear when you go, 
I go, go

Loose


Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run

The rats are on parade
Another mad charade
What you gonna do?
The hounds are on the chase
Everything's erased
What you gonna do?
I need some room to breath
You can stay asleep
If you wanted to
They say that's nothings free
You can run with me
If you wanted to

Yeah you can run with me
If you wanted to

Before the time runs out
There's somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run!

We are the nation's stakes
If everything's erased
What you gonna' do?
I need some room to breathe
You can run with me
If you wanted to

Yeah you can run with me
If you wanted to

Before the time runs out
There's somewhere to run
Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run!

Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run
We run
We run
Run!


There ain't no secrets anymore
My name's been hanging on the hook outside your door
Just an old eyesore

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

You're out of sight, I'm out of mind
Been sitting watch your pictures drying on the line
Just a game of mine

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I got this feeling, I can't keep it down anymore
Bring me some healing
Saint Cecilia, carry me home to your house of broken bones

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Days will come and go
No matter what I say
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by

I know no matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Days will come and go
No matter what I say (Saint Cecilia)
Nothing's set in stone
No matter what I say
Days go by


Breathe oh breathe now smother me
So clever me, I'm onto you

Sick of you

Sweet as torture at least we were alive
Cringe and burn [?] now mark my words and
Save your breath

Open wide, my crucify

Nervous we, oh jealousy
It's gonna be their debt to you
Bang bang bang

Cringe and burn [?] now mark my words so

Sweet as torture now mark my words and
Save your breath

Cause it's mine
Save your breath 
Cause it's mine


Hey I'm glad I caught you on the phone
Thirty hours until I'm back home
Been hallucinating, me and Sean
Time to turn his headlamp on
Yeah who you running from?

Someone left their haircut on the lawn
Twenty hours until I'm back home
Been commiserating, me and Sean
Think your face is getting long
Yeah who you running from?

(Sean)

You've been waiting in the waves
Waiting in the waves

I've been sipping poison just for fun
13 hours till I'm back home
Been obliterated, me and Sean
Getting good at getting gone
Yeah who you running from?

(Sean)


Seda can you hear me
Do you know my face
Perfect like a circle
Gone without a trace

So long I have known you
Marks upon your skin
I can picture everything
Can you picture this

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All the secrets bare for the world to see

Who will stand before you
If you don't say my name
Safe to say we will never know
We are both the same

I don't mind
I can always find you
Waiting there for me

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
All her secrets bare for the world to see

Seda doesn't care
She just sits and stares
Seda doesn't care
She's just dyin' there
Seda doesn't care
She's just lyin' there
All the secrets bare for you and me


These notes are marked return to sender
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh

These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm gettin' further from myself
One thins is always true, how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh
I'm done resenting you, you represented me so well
And this I promise you

How could I end up in this hands of someone else?
These notes are marked return to sender
I'll save this letter for myself
I wish you only knew how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh

These steps I take don't get me anywhere
I'm gettin' further from myself
One thins is always true, how good it is to see you
See you, see you, ooh, ooh


Looking for relief in your miserable life
You need some rock and roll
And you better get it right
Got to roll them bones
Do everything they say
If you're cool, you're the fool
Make it work every day

Rock out, do you quick
My, my, my, let it rip
Rock out, feeling good
Break your heart, shake your blood

Out upon the stage, crowd is going wild
Love to see them women, babe
I ain't in denial
Make you crazy too
Make you show it out
Feeling good, get some wood
You should, you knew you could

Rock out, do it now
My, my, my, show me how
Rock out, make it good
Break your heart, shake your blood

Want to be a winner, want to be the man.
Want to make yourself insane, join up with the band
Want to fall in love, want to make your mark
Want to get out in the storm, want to break a thousand hearts

Rock out, strike it rich
My, my, my, it's a bitch
Rock out, I knew you could
Break your heart, shake your blood

Rock out, don't you stop
My, my, my, ride the rock
Rock out, ain't so good
Break your heart, shake your blood


Stupid on the Steinway
So sick upon a Steinway
The sailors drown

See them talk and see them drown
And see them drink and fall around
Upon the floor

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Lonely in a crowded room
The radio plays out of tune
So silently

The radio upon the floor
Is stupid it plays aznavour
So out of key

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Broken on a ship of fools
Even dreams must fall to rules
So stupidly

Words are all just useless sound
Just like cards they fall around
And we will be

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Buy a car and watch it rust
Sister see them fall to dust
They fall around

In another crowded room
Paint me like the shirt I'm in
Honestly

Sister of mine, home again
Sister of mine, home again

Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister of mine
Sister.


Lately I've been measuring
Seems my time is growing thin
Wind me up and watch me spin
Watch me spin
Watch me spin

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones

All worn out and nothing fits
Brennivin and cigarettes
The more I give the less I get
But I'm all set
I'm all set

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones

Deep within this frame of mine
Heart of hearts a valentine
Tell my mom I'm doing fine
Doing fine
Doing fine

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Skin and bones
Don't you know?

I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just skin and bones
I'm just


Give me the flammable light
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go

Here lies a city on fire
Singing along
The arsonist choir
Now here I go

It's started with a spark
And burn into the dark
Now here I go

There is a river I've found
Into the wild
Under the ground
So here I go

A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go

Oh sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
Took my word, I took your wine

And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

But you can't make me change my name
They'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind now ain't that's something
Fuck it all I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse

It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh
All rise!

No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind no wait that's something
Fuck it all I came from nothing

I'm something
From nothing
I'm something
From nothing


One of these nights I'll shake you
I will take you from my veins
I'm getting tired of waiting
It's time to empty me

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me

Feeling me race inside you
And I feel you run through me
Funny how you remind me
I got memories to drain

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you love to watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me

Bleed me slowly, until every, vein is empty, just like you
Bleed me slowly, until every, vein is empty, just like you
Please oh, please you're draining me, I've got to bleed myself from you
Please oh, please you're draining me, I've got to bleed, I've got to bleed for you!

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you wanna watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me

We can rip apart this bleeding heart
Don't you love to watch me spill?
Bleed you outta me


Oh mirror mirror
You're coming in clear
I'm finally somewhere in between
I'm impressed
What a beautiful chest
I never meant to make a big scene

Will you resign to the latest design
You look so messy when you dress up in dreams
One more for hire
Or wonderful liar?
I think its time we all should come clean

Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?

God bless, what a sensitive mess
Yeah but things aren't always what they seem
Your teary eyes
Your famous disguise
Never knowing who to believe

See through
Yeah, but what do you do?
When you're just another aging drag queen?

Stack dead actors
Stacked to the rafters
Line up the bastards
All I want is the truth

Hey hey now, can you fake it?
Can you make it look like we want?
Hey hey now, can you take it?
And we cry when they all die blond?


Ssshhhh

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for. 
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven. 

What's the next line?

Ther... You sure?

There's a sign on the wall (pause)
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
With a word she can get what she came for. 

And it makes me wonder
Ooooooh... and it makes me wonder

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Yes, there are two paths you can go, but in the long run 
The piper's .....

(sings guitar solo, not play, sings!)

And as we wind on down the road 
Our shadows taller than our souls. 
There walks a lady we all know 
Who lights white light and wants to show 
(mumbling)
And if you listen very hard 
The tune will come to you at last. 
When all are one and one is all 
To be a rock and not to roll. 

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.


You and I were two old and tortured souls
Repaired by a love of broken things
In a life, just some bodies growing old
No fear of the end, of anything

We're just ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually

We got by, though we never needed much
A sliver of hope, no diamond rings
We got high, it was heaven it was hell
Flying over them, with broken wings

[Chorus]
We're just ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually
Oh, just two ordinary people, you and me
Time will turn us into statues, eventually

Our bones forever in stone
Monuments of life
To dust, as everything must
We fade away in time, oh

[Chorus]

Just two ordinary people you and me
Time will turn us into statues eventually


If you'd like to walk a while
We could waste the day
Follow me into the trees
I will lead the way

Bring some change up to the bridge
Bring some alcohol
There we'll make a final wish
Just before the fall

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Watch the sunrise all alone
Sitting on the tracks
Hear the train come roaring in
Never coming back

Laying quiet in the grass
Everything is still
River stones and broken bones
Scattered on the hill

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Here forever deep beneath the dirt
Never mind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one


Goddamn this dusty room
This hazy afternoon
I'm breathing in this silence
Like never before

This feeling that I get
This one last cigarette
As I lay awake
And wait for you to come through the door

Oh maybe maybe maybe
I can share it with you
I behave I behave I behave
So I can share it with you

You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know

I am not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

We'll dream about somewhere
Our smoke will fill the air
As I lay awake and wait
For you to walk out that door
I can change I can change I can change
But who do you want me to be
I'm the same I'm the same I'm the same
Oh do you want me to be

You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
You were not alone
Dear loneliness
You forgot
But I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know

I'm not alone
Dear loneliness
I forgot
That I remember this
Oh stranger stranger
Stranger things have happened, I know
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean

But the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky
Yet the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky

You might think you know me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

You might think you own me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Buried my heart, cannot go this alone, oh no
Poison this house, god in the stone
Oh no, you don't

Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean

But the truth is so unkind
What do you know, how low the sky

You might think you owe me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

I might think you love me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Bring all your lies leave them deep in the dirt
Oh no, you don't
Pull down my eyes
Lay me deep in the earth
Oh no, you don't

Nothing left within, I've been mined
Hell and back again, subterranean
I've been digging in down inside
I will start again, subterranean


Early morning without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the sun was dead
Make me warm or take me home
It's so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Come on over brave my storm
Ocean's overhead
Come inside my friend
Getting bad out there
Every moment we have stolen
All we had to share
No one wanted this
But you know I did
You know I did
This moment

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end

Meet me in the summer time
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Bloody lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
Just keep staring at the sun
Pray for summer's end


You say I take it for granted
I say you've taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceiling
When are you gonna come down?
When you're that high, can you feel it?

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

You wanna tell me a secret
You think I'm gonna find out
You tell the lie, you should keep it
Don't wanna know where it's leading
Don't want to follow you 'round
My first mistake was believing

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away? (do you give it away?)
Do you let go? (do you let go?)
Where do you find it?

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
How do you find it?

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
How do you find it?

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go? 
Oh


I don't wanna be king
I just wanna sing a love song
Pretend there's nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
I don't wanna be queen
Just trying to keep my t-shirt clean

There's one thing I have learned
If it gets much better
It's going to get worse

And you get what you deserve

And you get what you deserve


You're a real short ride, wow right
It'll beat you's up anyway, that's right
You're a teachers pet,  wow right
Sit and bleach one anyway, that's why

Color and the shape
Color and the shape

No sweat yeah, wow right
You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your ass away, wow right
Instead a river boy runs  away, that's right

Color and the shape
Color and the shape

You're a retard anyway, that's right
That is beat your hands away, wow right
Sell me river boy run away, that's why


Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded you
Your diamond in the rough

You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shinning once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one

One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

Every time I wonder
I go under

The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the brew the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black


That night they were burning for truth
Down on the corner of 14th and U
They took your soul and they took you for fools
Took all the windows from prisons and schools
Now what's a poor man left to do?

One heart now broken in two
You start untying the hands of the youth
New kids hear the sound of the drumming
Mother Nature your Summer is coming
Yesterday and today
Revolution on its way

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Crossroads with nothing to lose
Out of the basement and in to the news
Come change, now shit getting heavy
Salvation at the ready
You look when I walked by
Still screaming 'til I die
You can't find peace if you can't find a home
You can't survive as an island alone
Black heart with a gaping wound
Put back together by a troubled groove
Check yourself
Wreck your brains
Where is that P.M.A.?

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Hey, where is the monument?
To the dreams we forget?
We need a monument
And change will come
Yeah change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
There?

Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Amen
It was The Feast and the Famine
Feast and the Famine

Amen
Where is the monument?
To the dreams we forget?
Amen
We need a monument
And change will come
Is there anybody there? (Anybody there?)
Anybody there? (Anybody there?)
There?


This is the sound
The here and the now
You got to talk the talk, the talk, the talk
To get it all out

I listen
I listen
I listen

But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

Something I've found
Yea, That want to turn around
You got to walk the walk, the walk, the walk
To make any ground

You're pushing
You're pushing
You're pushing

But there ain't no room
No there ain't no room

This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm trough
This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you

And yours is a name
I will never name again
I will never name again

We pretend it doesn't matter
We pretend it all away
We pretend it all away

We pretend
We pretend
We pretend

But it ain't no use
This is the last song (This is the last song)
This is the last song (This is the last song)
That I will dedicate to you
I made my peace
And now I'm through

This is the last song
That I will dedicate to you
To you
To you
To you


Yes or no?
What is truth
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue?
I was wrong
I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night

Break my bones
I don't care
All I ever wanted was a body to share
Heart's gone cold
Brush ran dry
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like you

Somewhere?
Are you there?

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

Listen close
I can't hide
I'm a page torn from a broken spine
Sun gets low
I get high
Satellite searching for a sign of life
Like you

Somewhere?
Are you there?
The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

Are you there?
Are you there?

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line
This time

The tears in your eyes
Someday will dry
We fight for our lives
'Cause everything's on the line

Yes or no?
What is truth
But a dirty black cloud coming out of the blue
I was wrong
I was right
I'm a blood moon born in the dead of night


Woe is me
The end is near, thought you'd never leave
Heart and teeth
Just to taste bittersweet
One last stain to get beneath the skin
Beneath the skin

The wish is drawn inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
No one lets everyone in

Me and you
Draw the line
Now it's time to move
Face to face
Damn the luck, blessed be
Heaven, what's come over me?

The wishes come inside
The neverending sigh
No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in

No one lets everyone in
No one lets everyone in
My exit, no exit
Go on let everyone in
No one lets everyone in


Everyone makes one mistake
One more time for old times sake
One more time before the feeling fades

One that's born of memories
One more bruise you gave to me
One more test just how much can I take

Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Something never meant to be
Everything you meant to me
Wake me when this punishment is done

Those who try and get away
From the one who gets away
Someone's always someone else's one

Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Until the end of time
In another life
Until the day I die
Save it up for one more try
Save it for the last goodbye
We go on and get off
And get on and get off

Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit
You're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like shit

Because you're not the one but you're the only one
Who can make me feel like this
You're not the one but you're the only one 
Who can make me feel like
Oh shit


Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in, again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

In time our soul untold
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that will take you down
Bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say that I'll never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
(Who dares)
What if I say I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all pretend)
You're the pretender
(Who dares)
What if I say I will never surrender?

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Thoughts like a minefield
I'm a ticking bomb
Maybe you should watch your step
Don't get lost

Keep it down

Visiting is pretty
Visiting is good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a brother

This can be a secret
We can keep it good
Even all the ever wanting had a problem

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been far too long

Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking

Them balloons are pretty
Big and say they should
Ever fall to ground
Call the magic marker

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long

Minicyn is pretty
Minicyn is good
Seems that all the cysts and mollusks tend to barter

Ritalin is easy
Ritalin is good
Even all the ones
Who watered down the daughter

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long

Fingernails are pretty
Fingernails are good
Seems that all they ever wanted was a marking

Ever fall to ground
Call the magic marker

This is a call to all my
Past resignations
This is a call to all
This is a call to all my
Past resignations
It's been too long


The warmth of your love's 
Like the warmth from the sun
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come

Don't let go of my hand
Now the darkness has gone
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

I won't forget
The way you helped me up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said "Darling, I love you"
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

The warmth of your smile
Smile for me, little one
And this will be our year
Took a long time to come...

You don't have to worry
All your worried days are gone
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

And I won't forget
The way you helped me up when I was down
And I won't forget
The way you said "Darling, I love you"
You gave me faith to go on
Now we're there
And we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come

Yeah, we've only just begun
This will be our year
Took a long time to come


what's there at the door that changed my life
without a simple reason why
feel another afternoon
split my poor broken heart in two
it's not a friend that you and I
throwing needles at the sky
march with friends that's you today
put them on and walked away

I walked away
I walked away
I walked away

you laughed the while you kissed my head
talk about the time we spent
picking arms up from the sand
sure to never never land
in the middle of my story
fuel the bed to keep you warm
lie around and beat my head
feed the cactus, i'm instead

get lost instead
get lost instead
get lost instead

the end.... the end.... the end!


I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away
Then follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off alone

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I am a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again


(spoken)
Tiny dancer... 
two words... 
that strike a chord in the heart of every sensitive 32 year old man and...uh,
A song actually I don't think I'd ever heard until I saw... Almost Famous.  
So every night before going to bed, I thank Cameron Crowe, for... 
opening up a part of me that I don't think I ever knew... until now. 
(sings)
Blue jean baby,
LA lady,
seamtress for the band.
Pretty eyed,
pirate smiled,
you'll marry a music man.
Ballerina,
you must have seen her,
dancing in the sand.
Now she's in me,
always with me,
Tiny dancer in my hand.
(spoken)
You know let's skip all the other crap and just get to the chorus, like on that bus scene.
What do you say?
(crowd cheers)
Now, keep going, keep going... keep going, keep going... 
(crowd keeps cheering) There you go.
But you know what I really wanted to do, was I wanted to recreate that timeless scene in uh, Almost Famous. I wanted to do kind of like a performance art piece, where I'd have uh, a little kiddie pool and I'd jump in the kiddie pool, and then --on acid, and  uh andthen, then someone come and drape a towel on me and then have uh, uh ya know, Craig come behind me and uh, sing along to the, to the song.
But I think what I'm gonna need everybody to do is sing the chorus along so we can really recreate that magic. Right?
(crowd cheers)
OK?
Now I'm gonna count, I'm gonna give you a four count.
(crowd keeps cheering)
HEY THIS IS MY SHOW!
Alright, here we go... One, Two, Three, Four
(singing)
Hold me closer tiny dancer,
count the headlights on the highway,
lay me down in sheets of linen,
you had a busy day today.
(spoken)
One more time, come on! SING IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT!
(singing)
Hold me closer tiny dancer,
count the headlights on the highway,
lay me down in sheets of linen,
you had a busy day today.
ONE MORE TIME!!
Hold me closer tiny dancer,
count the headlights on the highway,
lay me down in sheets of li....nen,
you had a busy day todaaaay.
Blue jean baby....
(spoken/laughing) This is so stupid
LA lady
seamstress for the band.
Pretty ey...ed,
Pirate smi...led (kind of laughing now)
You'll marry a music man.
(spoken)
Oh my God, it keeps going.
(singing)
Ballerina,
you must have seen her,
dancing in the sand.
Now she's in me,
always with me
Tiny dancer, in my hand.
(spoken)
Ok, the teleprompter stopped.
So we gotta do the chorus one more time!
Two, Three, Four
(singing)
Hold me closer tiny dancer,
count the headlights on the highway,
lay me down in sheets of linen,
you had a busy day today.
(spoken)
OH YEAH!!!
There you go.




I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by
The diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
But is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired

Hanging on this wire
Waiting for the day I have to choose
Cursed by love so dire
One more boy for hire
One more boy to lend a hand to you
But it is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
Of you
Of you

I can be your liar
I can be your bearer of bad news
Sick and uninspired by
The diamonds in your fire
Burning like a flame inside of you
Is this just desire or the truth?

So shame on me for the ruse
Shame on me for the blues
Another one returned that I'll never use

I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
I won't go getting tired of you
I won't go getting tired of you
I'm not getting tired
Of you


Touch, light as a feather.
I will wait for you honestly.
I am yours - entirely.

I remember last night's dream.
Could it be your one of me?

I've known the face inside the window.
And the voice forever in my heart.
Like an angel's arrow.

I remember last night's dream.
Could it be your one of me?
I've been waiting silently.
Would you risk it all, with me?

Ah, Ah, Ah.
Ah, Ah, Ah.

(Guitar solo)

Touch, light as a feather. (I've known the face inside the window.)

Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.
Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.

Peace brought back, bought back.
Relaxed be nyet, brought back.
Did you dry her out, and wind her out like jerky?
To me she's healed to attack.

Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.
Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.

Children nailed to the cross.
Pain does not look our hell.
Certainly is not a spell.
Sweet waste from a well.

Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.
Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.

(guitar solo)

Winds quiet in the night.
Her body just blows messiah!
Sickening sweet sight left or right.
Is all right, does not please my appetite.

Two-headed dog, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.
Two-headed, two headed, two headed dog.
I've been working in the Kremlin with a two-headed dog.
Two-headed, two headed, two headed dog.
Two-headed, two headed, two headed dog.
Two-headed, two headed, two headed dog.


The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

The rain is here, and you, my dear, are still my friend
It's true, the two of us are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

Together now, I don't know how this love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart for you to mend
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you

Always coming back I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again


Dearest constellation, heaven surroundin' you
Stay there, soft and blue.
Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight
Sweetest invitation, breaking the day in two
Feelin' like I do, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
Hear me callin' you, Virginia moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shapes become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

Virginia Moon, I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shapes become shadows in your light
In the morning when we're through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

I will say goodnight
I will say goodnight


A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Getting good at starting over
Every time that I return

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the days?
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growing stronger
Little conquerors

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

Now,
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, again
To keep alive, a moment at a time
That's still inside, a whisper to a riot
The sacrifice, the knowing to survive
The first decline, another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die

I never wanna die
I never wanna die
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die
I'm dancing on my grave
I'm running through the fire
Forever, whenever
I never wanna die
I never wanna leave
I'll never say goodbye
Forever, whenever
Forever, whenever

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?


Got my good side at the ready
If the other one is on the mend
Feel it in my bones when you break my back
Break it just to watch me bend
Anyway for once you admit it
No matter what your good book says
Never lookin' back 'cause I ain't no saint
Just another teenage head

You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white

Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Ain't no turning back cause I'm walkin' a line, 
Walkin' a line, walkin' a line
For you

Maybe if you swear you'll save me
Maybe save myself instead
Swear across my heart and I hope to die
Maybe we could just play dead
Runnin' out of time but I'm ready
Run out when I run this red
See you on the chase, I will track you down
Even though you're miles ahead

You gotta, wait for the feeling and you wait for the feeling
And you wait, and you shiver and you shake
Crawlin' back and forth from the black and white

Over and over again
Over and over and over again
Ain't no turning back no there ain't no turning back,
No there ain't no turning back, no there ain't no turning back
Ain't no turning back 'cause I'm walkin' a line
Walkin' a line for you


Tonight I'm tangled in my blanket of clouds
Dreaming aloud

Things just won't do without you, matter of fact
Oh oh ooh
I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh oh ooh
I'm on your back

If you'd accept surrender, I'll give up some more
Weren't you adored

I cannot be without you, matter of fact
Oh oh ooh
I'm on your back

If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you

Another heart is cracked in two
I'm on your back

I cannot be without you, matter of fact
Oh oh ooh
I'm on your back
I'm on your back
Oh oh ooh
I'm on your back

If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you
If you walk out on me
I'm walking after you


I stick it to the mailman
I'm pinned against a pot plant
I'm sick of all the sun-tan
Oily with the ray-ban

Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon

I'm skinny as a spit pan
Dealing with the shit plan
Playing with my bad hand
Just another rock band

Take that to the man
and call it a check
Trapped within a contract

Hey there boy while you were catching the black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead

Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait

Hey man can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead

Pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait

I'm molasses hung in rent
Read a sponsor one shot no post-show
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
As if you blame real and stagnate
Big shit no shit

Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Some try that hit beast and mud lead
Big shit no shit

Tear it off, but not a lot, only so much you can take
Tear it off, but not a lot, it's not enough to debate
Big shit no duh

Right?
One shot nothing

There you go again
Putting words into my mouth
This one's for you to know
And for me to find out

All that trouble, and you on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
Stop, ask myself what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?
Come on, tell me now what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?

I heard every word comin' from the 13th floor
Your song came along
And I heard the voices telling me to save yourself
I'll behave yourself

I stop, ask myself what did I do?
What can I do to preserve you?
Come on, tell me now, what can I do?
What can I do to conserve you?

Your name, year of fame
I could see the writing on the wall
Come on, flip a coin, bet it's going to tell you
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself

Your man, channelin', knowin' by the X on his hand
You raise, runaways singin' at the gate
To save yourself, I'll behave yourself

So here I go again
Putting words into your mouth
This one's for me to know
And for you to find out

All that trouble and I'm on about
How you gonna know, til you hear it out loud
All of your heroes, where are they now?

I'm lost, deliver me
I crossed the river finally
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah it's gonna heal my soul tonight

God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness
Yeah you gonna heal my soul tonight


Back and forth that voice of yours keeps me up at night
Help me search to find the words that eat you up inside
I go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane
And I only hide what is on my mind because I can't explain

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

It's my turn, this soul won't burn so throw me in the fire
Trophies earned and lessons learned, your wicked little lies
We can pave new roads with the cold gravestones, wind them through the pines
Should I stay or should I go alone? I cannot decide

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline

What if I do love
What if I don't?
I'd have to lose everything just to find you
What if I do love
What if I don't
I'd have to lose everything just to find you

Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline
Carolina, Caroline


One, two, three, four
I know what you're thinkin'
We were goin' down
I can feel the sinkin'
But then I came around

And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky

Well we all want something better than
We wish for something new
Well we all want something beautiful
I wish for something true
Been lookin' for a reason and
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (when the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (when the wheels come down)

Now your head is spinnin'
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Comin' to an end

Well, you wanted something better man
You wished for something new
Well, you wanted something beautiful
Wished for something true
Been lookin' for a reason and
Something to lose

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)

When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)


I'll take you out of the wishin' well
I thinkin' I have a plan
Go with your bad self
Why did you cheat yourself?
You think you're losing
China's not accusing
You never gonna take a hit on the head
Now if you don't care
Take a ride somewhere

Hey you got something
You gotta try and buy our soul
Hey you got something
It goes round and round again
Go, go, you should've never waste your lung
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go limo, go limo

I got you stuck in the habit trail
You've grown to lovin' this shit
Way out on a back shelf
Yeah you don't know what you've done
Look what you're doin'
Now mama says it's ruined
You've got a mollusk in the palm of your hand
So it's a bad smell
Your eyes wanna win

Hey you got something
You wanna try and buy our soul
Hey you got something
It goes round and round and round again
Go, go, you're never having to waste your lung
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go, go, whatever happened to Day-Glo Jones?
Go, go, and the ride was shared
Go limo, go limo


I'm hangin' around, I not puttin' down the state I'm in 
I've never been proud, And now I'm allowed to shed my skin 

I'm driving away, I know if I stay I'll sit and spin. 
Imagine the day, I'm drowning if they can reel me in 
Pick up where I left off 

Lets make a bet 
We'll make a bargain and call this truce 
Let's make a bet 
I'm in loss and win or lose with you 

I see it all now, I'm taking my bow in everything 
Comes crashing around, Its getting too loud the space I'm in 

So now I can leave, two pieces of me some evidence 
The one that relieves, the others disease like medicine 
Pick up where I left off 

Lets make a bet 
We'll make a bargain and call this truce 
Let's make a bet 
I'm in loss and win or lose 

Speakin' in tongues I can't get through 
Think of runnin' but 
I'm tired of runnin' into you 
Speakin' in tongues the way I do 
Found that you understand quite well 
Cause that's your language too 

I'm hangin' around, I'm not puttin' down the state I'm in 
In love with the sound, its gettin' too loud


I have a choice between the bat or the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confessions, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind, I don't mind 'cause I'll catch up!
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up

Will I be happy on the back of the shelf?
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell?
Spare me the questions since you know me so well
Someday you'll realize I get shy and I choke up!
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal?
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up

Farewell, my sweet paramania
Farewell, my sweet paramania
My only promise is that I'll never tell
Keep you at a distance from the things that I felt
I'll bite the bullet, take the beating until
I take it all back anyway.

What was I supposed to say?
Want a song that's indelible, like manimal,
I hope you never see me wind up
What is wrong with this animal?
I'm terrible
I hope you never see me wind up


Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Feed the lawn from the palms of their hands
Never holding, to a pole
Winnebago, we were one
Hold in wonder, spoke and wheel
She divorces, party zeal

Daddy loves little son, no demand
Able bodied, chew the word
Cop to plenty, sell the tour
Split the moment, seal the sheet
Take the hemlock, beg to see

Crawl along, lookin' up 'til you standorld


Well I just heard
The news today
Seems my life
Is gonna change
I close my eyes
Begin to pray
As tears come streamin'
Down my face

With Arms Wide Open
Into the sunlight
I'll give you everything
Show you everything
With Arms Wide Open

Thank you brother

With Arms Wide Open

Enunciate
The way I please
I pray now
I'm on my knees
I went to church
On Sunday
Start the band
Start to get paid

With Arms Wide Open
Into the Puzin church


Goodbye Jimmy, farewell youth
I must be on my way I have had enough of you
I was a young man proud and true
Just a simple boy with nothing else to lose
Years that I've wasted these I owe you's
They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air you better save your breath
Say have you heard
Say have you heard
The poison in my heart voices in my head
Years that I've waited these I owe you's
I meant every word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
But it's only words
I meant every word
They're just fucking words
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward

Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward
Word for word for word forward


When all is said and done
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these broken wings floating
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

On into the sun
On into the sun

Looking down at you, sleeping
From above, I love
Looking down at you, weeping
From above, I love

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

When all is dead and gone
And the air we breathe is not enough
To keep these dying arms, see them
Carry on into the sun, into the sun

I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

Heaven skies are reeling
And my hand that holds the world
Deep inside I'm reaching
Into the universe

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns
And if it has no end
The lonely heart that learns
Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Over and over again
I ride the wheel that turns
Over and over again
I find the soul that burns


Leading everything along
Never far from being wrong
Never mind these things at all
It's nothing

Couldn't find a way to you
Seems that's all I ever do
Turning up in black and blue
Rewarded

All the static we all left

Wait until the time has come
Figure that's where time comes from
Leaving all my senses numb
Is heaven

Lifted up the fay to seen
Anything could never be
Anything but play to me
In order

Take it back for them to keep
Fallen into something deep
Not that I had made that leap
Anointed

Where have all the wishes gone
Now that all of that is done
Wish I would've felt I've won
For once


Oh she's only seventeen
Whine whine whine, weep over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the street
Brothers fighting, when's the baby gonna sleep
Heaving ship too sails away

Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tic in her head that made me feel so strange
So I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of your Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay

Oh she's only seventeen
Whine whine whine, weep over everything
Bloody Mary breakfast busting up the street
Brothers fighting, when's the baby gonna sleep
Heaving ship too sails away

Said it's a culmination of a story and a goodbye session
It's a tick of our time and the tic in her head that made me feel so strange
Said I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of her Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay

I could call you baby, I could call you, dammit, it's a one in a million
Oh it's the rolling of your Spanish tongue that made me wanna stay


That taste
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Just too dumb to surrender
She shakes Like a mornin railway checking me out
Someone on her shoulder
The lamp
Flickers in the bedroom
She must feel it's awkward
Or it's Arizona
Now go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to surrender
To drunk to remember
Shake hands
My face
Is layin' on the pavement
Tastin' something awful I hate when that happens
She'll wave
Bein' then that it's sexy,
She must be plum crazy
I kinda think I like her
I kinda think I do


My corner, you'll find me every day
The boys come out
That's where we like to play
Gonna tag along, I'll set the way
And tried to get high
What price you gonna pay

Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)

Keep dancing, like it's your last time
We're so thin ice, swimming in delight
When the curtain falls, I'm on your scene
"What sweet surprise" she shared to me

Been around the world been around the world
The stormy gates and the maiden Pearl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
Take it all the way, take it all the way
All the way
(All around the world all around the world)
(All around the world all around the world)
All around the world all around the world
I lost myself and found a girl
(All around the world all around the world)


Come on out and dance,
If you get the chance,
We're gonna spit on the rival.
All's I wanna know,
Is how far you wanna go,
Fighting for survival.

Underneath the stars,
Where we parked the cars,
Ain't showing signs of stopping.
Pretty little girls,
Naked to their curls,
Ready to lay in a coffin.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I gotta fire burning.
Go on take my hand,
When we see the man,
Baby's gonna be a big one.
Baby's gonna be a big one.

When you see the lights,
And when we hear the fights,
It's gonna be a stunner.
I've got something here,
If you give me one more beer,
I'm gonna call a runner.
I don't want to say,
What I have to say,
If I'm kicking off now.
If you wanna go,
I'm gonna go,
I'm going back down south now ahh
I'm going back down south now ahh
I'm going back down south now.

If you wanna go,
I'm going back down south now.
Come on take my hand,
I'm going back down south now.
When we see the lights,
And we hear those fights,
I'm going back down south now.
All I want to know,
Is how far you wanna go,
I'm going back down south now oh yeah.

I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
I'm going back down south now.
Oh, yeah.


Taking to the floor with the wheel to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake your way, I shake your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake your way, I shake your way
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance, I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door, it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody

Now is your time and you know where you stand
With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand
Now I'm no longer an ordinary man
Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand
And I say you can't get enough
No you can't get enough

Given a chance, I'm gonna be somebody
If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody
Open the door, it's gonna make you love me
Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody

Be somebody
Be somebody.


Got an attitude
Thinking that he's always right
Blowin' smoke rings
Making me wanna fight

I never look back
At all the things I've ever done
I never look up
Seeing that he's on the run
Seeing that he's on the run

It's a big thing
Everything the heart desires
And now I have to
Try to out do the fight

I caught a big break
Went to play in the road
I saw you laughing
Even though you know it's old

Even though you know it's old
Even though you know it's old

Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run
Even when you're on the run

Even when you're on the run

Even though you know it's old


Bite your tongue
Don't make a scene dear
Everybody's been here
At least once before
But we've been here more
Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I've seen it all go
Comeback around
I've heard the sound

The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I say love
Don't mean nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war

When I hold
The warmth of your body
There is nobody
That I'd rather hold
Shattered and cold

The tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is making me crazy
I say love
Don't mean nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war

I say love
You don't need nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war

I say love
I say love
Don't need nothing
Left them something,
Worth fighting for

I say love
Don't need nothing
Left them something
Worth fighting for

It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war
It's a beautiful war


Degrade me, my purpose
Bury me beneath the surface

I'm scratching, I'm clawing
Trying hard to make them pay

Can't stand me, beside me
Kid you not, your kiss sure killed me

The cold of my barrel
Never sees the light of day

Call me, call me, you could only hurt the story
Call me, call me, I'll be there to shine a light

The smell on the speakers
Sweaty ballroom dancing fever

They gather in numbers
Ever for a closer view

The cease fire the weaker
Hair so red I couldn't keep her

The dogs hound the neighbors
Everything was blown away

Call me, call me, you could only hurt the story
Call me, call me, I'll be there to shine a light

Machine, machines, point me to the nearest party
You'll see, you'll see, baby it's the only way

Call me, call me, you could only
Call me, call me, I'll be there

Machines, machines, point me to the nearest party


It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the curve of your pretty gown
You come on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose

We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you

Walking her home with the grassy field
Fallin' and laughin' at the drinks we spilled
Just one of those nights that I had to share
She's in a daze, without a care

We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you

We gonna come together, we gonna celebrate
We gonna gather 'round, like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know, just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where your going, I'm coming along with you


My cold, cold sailor heart says, "Get on your way."
I ain't too proud to say it but that's how I'm made
I'll be that person 'till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

From runways to the road I ramble alone
This thumbnail sized heart is black as coal
Though beauty it still bring me to my knee
Don't waste a tear on me this my disease

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I've run off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

Those preppy boys in blue they're making fun of us
So we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery cuss
But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to come around with the tumbleweed

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I've run up in your sleeve
Don't leave no smell on me

Now guitar, go get her

Don't take these boots off me when you thinking I'm dead
I'll still be running from the demon in my head
I'll be that person 'till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I know I'm up your sleeve
Don't leave no smell on me

Don't leave no, no smell


Little Mona Lisa laying by my side
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime
I feel too close to be losin' touch
By givin' in, what am I givin' up
Am I losin' way too much

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

I'm goin' so fast that I can't slow down
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' round and round
I'd give you the the news but nothin's changed
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life
Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

Hey
California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
Say
While you're tryin' to save me
Can't I get back my lonely life

Can't I get back my lonely life
Can't I get back my lonely life


She look so cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
I brought my fight next to her Camaro
And when I fire on a smile then she blows, she blows

I'm makin' eyes through my sharp sunglasses
She's such a brat now I'm packin' her cigarettes
I guess I'll take off these great sunglasses
It makes her look me in the eye before she's taken away

So cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
She looks so cool in that new Camaro
So black as coal and it goes, don't it go go go

She look so cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
I brought my fight next to her Camaro
And when I fire on a smile then she blows, she blows
She blows, she blows


Hang your weary head you seem defeated
Like the little girl you've been with cheated
And in the conversation had to go too far
Now your dropped off drunk in the back of your heart

So dry your lily eyes don't be so cruel
Using all you know it's meant for fools

See you're smoking up in the parking lot
Shake your little butt, show 'em what you got
Hot and the men all want and the chase is on?
Now your flag is flying in the dark and cold

So dry your lily eyes don't be so cruel
Using all you know it's meant for fools

It's in a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air

Are y'all giving up? Don't want to know now
And everybody sees everybody in your town
Oh, and the small town girl she went and got a bar
She gonna shake it off she gonna give 'em what she's got

So dry your lily eyes don't be so cruel
Using aw you know, I said it's meant for fools

This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air
This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air


She's such a charmer oh no
She's such a charmer oh no
She's always looking at me
She's always looking at me
She's such a charmer oh no
Oh no

She stole my karma oh no
Sold it to the farmer oh no
She's always looking at me
She's always looking at me
She's such charmer oh no
Oh no

Born in West Virginia oh no
Married to the preacher oh no
She's always looking at me
She's always looking at me
She's such a charmer oh no
Oh no

She's always looking at me
She's always looking at me
She's such a charmer oh no
Oh no


Stranded in this spooky town
Stoplight is swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying
Baby I'll bleed you dry
Skies are blinking at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

You shimmy-shook my boat
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me
Where am I now
Baby where do I sleep
Feels so good but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking its toll

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer


I'm on the corner, waiting for a light to come on
That's when I know that you're alone
It's cold in the desert, water never sees the ground
Special unspoken without sound

You told me you loved me, that I'd never die alone
Hand over your heart, let's go home
Everyone noticed, everyone has seen the signs
I've always been known to cross lines

I've never ever cried when I was feeling down
I've always been scared of the sound
Jesus don't love me, no one ever carried my load
I'm too young to feel this old

Is it you, is it me
Or does nobody know, nobody see
Nobody but me.


Picking up the pieces in the world I know
With one in the fire and one in the snow
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime

Bent on believing everything is alright
I break with the day and I've been with the night
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes/

The brighter the lights they're burning me out
Everyone says it's a lovely sound
I don't know where they are leaving me
Trying my best, hoping that you'll see

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your

I walk a mile in your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes/

You'll rue the day when you understand
I did my best to be an honest man
Race isn't over to the finish line
It's a comeback story of a lifetime

I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes

Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes
Now I'm a mile away


Rose and wine and
Skin and cigarette
Locks fall down your neck
I saw you right be
Fore your eyes caught mine
Better than the rest

And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again

And you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again

I got the feeling coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh

Callous hands and
Grimace hides a smile
Faith so close in time
I'm enough for talking
I'm turned and pushed aside
Fearless creatures fight

And I can feel it coming back again
I got a feeling coming back again

And now you got me on the ropes
Yeah, you got me on the ropes again

I got the feeling coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back, oh oh oh oh oh oh

I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I got the feeling coming back, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I can feel it coming back again, oh oh oh oh oh oh


Take me back to California
To those crystal neon signs
The traveling sensation
I'm blinded by the light
There are eyes on every corner
Blow your brains in random smiles
There are coats of many colors
Flying high up in the sky

Won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece

Look at all these shattered faces
They all look so out of place
They've got nothing left to live for
They'll be dead before they wait

I'd love to know just what you're thinking
Tell me what I ought to do
I will never leave you lonely
You're the one I'm runnin' to

Get me out of California
Take out there to the blue
We could make it out together
To the places calling you

Won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece

Oh won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Oh won't you come round my way
For some conversation, please
Oh, won't you come round my way
It's a conversation piece


You fault my pride
Don't ever need to apologize
As your lips unfold
Shakin' purple from the cold

You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spitting out
Is your grave unscathed
The worm is counting down the days

He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way

As the rat, and the fly
They're searching for an alibi
As we await the wrath
They never went to Sunday Mass

They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
Before they walk away
Before they walk away

The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As their hypocrisy unfolds
Oh hell is truly on its way


Toss me a breath, when you hold me down
Hot like a razor on my face
Something's growing that don't help me now
Paging the doctor just in case

Low and behold things are killing me
Silly expectations of a dream
Girls are gonna love the way I toss my hair
Boys are gonna hate the way I seem

Peach Christmas lights spitting German ling
Feels like a fast or homeless sleep
At least there's a record that I love to play
Dreaming about a place I'll never see

Such a swine, lips like wine but it don't matter to me
Take a turn before I burn and it don't matter to me
Like a snake awake and vague, it don't matter to me
I can fuck or I can fight, it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa

Uncle Sam, he looks ?, but it don't matter to me
I don't know where I'm gonna go, it don't matter to me
You could be ? my seed but it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa

I'm not a man everybody said but it don't matter to me
I get her feet on my seat but' it don't matter to me
Break my heart tear me apart, it don't matter to me, no no
I put a shine in your eye it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa


Dusty and you are, dirty from chain
Lips of your kisses are sticking like tape
Woke you at sunrise, cold as a grave
I'll cut you some flowers, now don't be afraid
Now don't be afraid

I'm looking for something, just sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing,
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine
Home by the river, tall grass and fields,
Pond of willow oak, well for to kneel
Dusty O Dusty, decision night, don't be so pretty,
All laced up in white, all laced up in white

I'm looking for something, just sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing,
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

I'm looking for something, just sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing,
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

I'm looking for something, just sink in my teeth without any crying
But I can't find no place or nothing,
Where thrills are cheap and love is divine

Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine
Where thrills are cheap, and love's divine


Out here looking for the good life
Tongue in my cheek and your back in my knife
I keep pushing through, my eyes right on you
Everyone says you should get away, fast as you can
But I know you'll stay, you never fall behind
It's always on your mind

You're somewhere I wanna go
Nice and swift as we take it slow
Well were on our way
Don't never hesitate
I'll hide in the dark in the back of your brain
And laugh a little louder as we go insane
No time to waste
I never come too late

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

Oh, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

You're a misfit and I'm your freak
Dance all night till our knees go weak
We could shut this place down
No one else is around
I try hard to understand
The crush of the world in the palm of your hand
You know we sit just right
Let's run away from the night

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

Well babe, I believe it when I see it
I'll believe it when I see it

Tongue in your cheek and back in my knife
Out here looking for the good life
Keep on pushing through, I got eyes on you
Baby, you know that we're on our way
Misfit and freak every single day
Sittin' ten feet tall, let's go take it all

If you don't like it
Then try it
If you don't like it
Then try it

I know you can see it, I'll believe it
You can see it, I believe it

We're here for a moment
So let's own it
For a moment, so let's own it

It's here for the taking
Why you waiting?
This good loving is worth making


I tell you now that I don't understand
Why everybody gives a big hi-damn
Oh where I'm going to
Don't mean a thing to you

I see you sitting in your masquerade
I'd love to pour you some of my lemonade
And get it off alright
We're caught in an early night

I know you hate me so, but I ain't gonna go
I'm staying here all right

I am your family tree
I know your A to Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighborly

I see your hands are shaking but
My heart is breaking me down

Its a pretty day and I'm gonna get alright
I lost my head and you ain't nowhere in sight
I see you got it all wrong
I got no calls on my phone

I just keep holding out, until I find a doubt
That you ain't coming home

I am your family tree
I know your A to Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighborly

I see your hands are shaking but
My heart is breaking me down

I am your family tree
I know your A to Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me

I am your family tree
I know your A to Z
I got a secret proposition lay your hands on me

I am your family tree
I know your A to Z
This is a secret proposition lay your hands on me
Not gonna talk about darlin', its so neighborly

I see your hands are shaking but
My heart is breaking me down

I see your hands are shaking but
My heart is breaking me down


Home grown
Rock to the rhythm, and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
You can play with me

And all the bros
Try for the courage and try for charity's tight clothes
She got a hat and all he has is his asshole
She'll be a' boppin to me

And her hair-do
He knows the lipstick kisses, oh yeah that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

Now take me down
Don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
Don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me

All of London sings
'Cause England's swings and they sure love the tales I bring
You know the rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King
The King they want to see

Home grown
Rock to the rhythm, and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't gotta sing but you got the face to play the role
You can play with me

And her hair-do
And those lipstick kisses, oh yeah that's the right move
Makes me feel like I'm the one who's moving you
The only one you see

All of London sings
'Cause England's swings and they sure love the tales I bring
And those the rainy days they ain't so bad when you're the King

I see you on a western sky
All my best tonight
Out in the dark
You always seem to come my way
Come and take your shape
Out on the stars
I really wanna know your name
See your face, know who you are, who you are

How did ya find me, how did ya find me?
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me how did ya find me
Up in the shadow, picking up my load

I'm waiting on the smoke to rise from behind your eyes
Send me away
Follow me into the wild with a twisted smile, I can't escape
Now I got you by my side, all my life, day after day
From the grave

How did ya find me how did ya find me
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me how did ya find me
Up in the shadows, picking up my load

I see you under western skies
Behind your eyes
I can escape
From the grave

How did ya find me how did ya find me?
What are you looking for, are you looking for
How did ya find me how did ya find me?
Up in the shadows, what are you looking for

How did ya find me how did ya find me?


Huff men don't take no nonsense
He's here to rectify
He's got his black belt buckle
And the red mans fire in his eyes

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
For kicks, who's struttin' now?

This party's overrated
But there ain't shit else to do
She's a lovin' on the boy from the city
I'll be lovin' him under my shoe

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south
We'll take to the yard like a cock fight
For kicks, who's struttin' now?

You with your switchblade posse
I'll get my guns from the south

Find yourself a new frontier
'Cause life is going, going gone
Fly yourself away from here 'til you're clear
Before it's going, going, gone

Say it loud and in the light
For it's going, going gone
Shake the hands, the hands that pick people fight
'Cause life is going, going gone

Yes I'll find you and cut you down
Friends and neighbours, sleepy town
If you wake up before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, we go
We live until we live no more

Travel with the dead black eye
Before it's come and come and gone
Cradles and the rocking chairs beneath the light
Before it's come and come and gone

Yes I'll find you and cut you down
Friends and neighbours, sleepy town
If you wake up before the blow
Pick your face up
We come, and go
We come and go, oh oh oh
We come and go, oh oh oh oh


Everybody wants to be a showman
Yeah they all got another one
Everybody thinks they got a genius
Everybody got me on the run
Sometimes I think they come here
Just so you can say that you can
And I can't get alone in my bathroom
I need to give myself a hand

Ya'll c-c-c-creepin'
Creepin' underneath my skin
Fuck you and your flashbulbs
Snappin' my picture again
You drank all my whiskey
You stole all my smoke
And you're crowded all around me
Like I got nowhere to go

Eyes are gonna roll back
I'm here to kill time
For you to go I'ma gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't looking to make no deals here no

You keep sticking to me like a prickly porcupine
You're getting your information from the grocery checkout line
Are you through confessing of your little girl obsession
'Cause I was only messing and I had a little time

Eyes are gonna roll back
I'm here to kill time
For you to go I'ma gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't looking to make no deals here no

Eyes are gonna roll back
I'm here to kill time
For you to go I'm a gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't looking to make no deals here no

Eyes are gonna roll back
I'm here to kill time
For you to go I'ma gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king running near the wheel
I ain't looking to make no deals here no


On our way, so it seems, blooming flowers waltz before me
Rollin' numbers, passing time, got to get outside the city,
In the morning all will see, just how crazy young love can be
On our own away again, don't get down my darlin'

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,
Look out your window I'm on your street

Miles away, so unclear, almost lost it in Montana
Lets pull over, have us a choke
I love to watch you when your dancin'
I wonder if they ever dream, they would get just what we gave them
All wrapped up in being nineteen, chasin' stars that are fallin'

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,
Look out your window I'm on your street

When that train heads home,
They're gonna be so gone gone, you ain't never gonna see me
I'm a gone gone, you ain't nothin to me
When they shine them streets, they're gonna find our song

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,
Look out your window I'm on your street

I'm gonna tangle my face hair, it's gonna tickle your daughter
Three o'clock and the moaning, they all cry to me,
I'll be prancin' around in my high heels, and your cherry red lipstick,
Look out your window I'm on your street

I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your
I'm on your street, they all cry to me
I'm on your street, they all cry to me


Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes (X2) 
Conversation, Mississippi related, he's searching for the softball diamond. 

Prancin' like a bad ass who never seen a church house, another jolly face in the choir. 

He's reaching and a kissin her mouth 
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes (X2) 

Screamin' at the cousin that never gets no lovin', the hairy monkeys covered tonight. 
Falling over tables, a black eye with no way home.And pouting underneath the street lights. 

He's reaching and a kissin her mouth 
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes (X2) 
And no-one seems to like it out loud 
Oh, he's such a sucker from her head to her toes (X8)


My darling you look lovely
I've come to lay you down
Uncover your head and submit to me
We'll make a joyful sound
I don't care if you're by yourself
Or you're all alone when you need my help
Keep that smile on your pretty face
Cause you don't have much I can't take away

Don't you worry baby
You won't feel a thing
Close your eyes
Holy roller Novocaine

You'll be hearin' me comin'
But I can't come inside
I'll be out back in my white Cadillac
Won't you join me for a ride
We'll go up to the mountain top
There I'll show all the goods I got
Don't look back keep your eyes ahead
This could be the night that the moon goes red, oh Lord!

Don't you worry baby
You won't feel a thing
Close your eyes
Holy roller Novocaine

Get back on track, pick me up some bottles of booze
Fickle freshman, probably thinks she's cooler than you
A hay ride at five, everybody's comin' around
So go press you skirt, word is there's a new girl in town.

I call shotgun, you can play your R 'n B tunes
The fellowship time, it always comes a little too soon
The land of the creeds, freshened up from baby faced shame
Put your eyes on me, and I know a place that we can get away.

Just say I want you, just exactly like I used to
'Cause baby this is only bringin' me down.

Home-boy's so proud, he finally got the video proof
The night vision shows, she was only duckin' the truth
It's heavy I know, the black guy with the gift down below
A choke and a gag, she spit up 'n came back for more.

She said I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.
She said I want you

I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.
I said I want you, just exactly like I used to
And baby this is only bringin' me down.


Blistered cracked and bleeding
Cold no one should know
Rain falls down a freezing
And sticking like a snow

Lingering suspicions
Screaming in my head
Lies all mixed up with omissions
Aw welcome home again
It's too late for apologies they're falling at my feet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
Caught him laying with my girlfriend
And now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead

Calling all the neighbors
Time to make amends
Whiskey floods the table
Aw good friends 'til the end
They're making silly faces and it's tasting bitter sweet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
Caught him laying with my girlfriend
Now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead

It's too late for apologies they're falling at my feet

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
Caught him laying with my girlfriend
And now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead

This is just the way of the world Joe said
I had to put a bullet into his head
And then lit up a cigarette
Decided to call his fat friend Fred
Well he said Fred I just killed a man
Caught him laying with my girlfriend
And now they're both dead, people can be so cold when they're dead


He's so purity, a shaven and a mourning,
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray

Straight in the picture pose,
He's coming around to meet you

And screaming like a battle cry, its more if I stay

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

How dare you some to me like with nail for a favor,
Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start

Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend,
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

Me and your cold, driving in the snow,
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll,
Let the good times roll

Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.
Good time to roll on.


I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy

She don't care what her momma says
No she gonna have my baby
Taking all that I have to take
This takings gonna shake me

People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other

And in the dark we say we don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

People call us renegades
Cause we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and you's a drunk
But I love her like no other

And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Takin' off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy

She don't care what her momma says
No she gonna have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take
This takings gonna shape me

(Whoa-a oh oh oh)
(Whoa-a oh oh oh)


Take it back, I never meant it
Never thought it would come to pass
Baby know it's not forgotten baby
Know that this is gonna last

By and large I had it coming
I recall the tremble in your eyes
I just want to make it better
I just want to make it right

Driven on the last mile home, driven on the last mile home
Things are always better, when were all together
I'm driving on the last mile home

Tell me that the bar is drinking,
And the lights are swinging in the smoke
I'm a fool for conversation,
And I've got nowhere to go

Dreamin' on the last mile home, dreamin' on the mile last home
Things are always better, when were all together
I'm dreamin' on the last mile home

Dreamin' on the last mile home, dreamin' on the last mile home
Things are always better when were all together
I'm dreamin' on the last mile home

Driven on the last mile home
Dreaming on the last mile home
Things are always better, when were all together
I'm dreamin' on the last mile home

Dreamin' on the last mile home, dreamin' on the mile last home
Things are always better, when were all together
I'm dreamin' on the last mile home

Baby I'm the one who's broken
Maybe I'm the breaker of the hearts
Been so lone since we've spoken
It's been lonely baby its been hard


I ain't gonna sell my soul to the devil,
Ain't gonna get down on her level,
Ain't gonna sell my soul to Lucifer,
Tell your girlfriend I ain't got no use for her,

Ahaaa, ooh

I ain't gonna sell my soul to the devil
I ain't gonna get down on her level
I ain't gonna sell my soul to Lucifer
Now tell your girlfriend I ain't got no use for her

Ahaaahaha ahaahaha, 

I went and I sold my soul to Jesus
And nobody knows just what he means to us
I went and I got me some of that holy-ghost fire
Ain't nothing in this world that can take me higher

Ahaahaha ahaahaha ahaahaha haahahaahahaha


I like to dance all night
It summons the day
That's how I play
Yeah that's how I play

I said who are you
No matter who you are
So we dance all night
And dance all day

I say
I say

We're gonna fuel the fire
We're gonna stoke it up
We're gonna sip this wine
And pass the cup

Who needs avenues
Who needs reservoirs
We're gonna show this town
How to kiss these stars

I say
I say

I'm on a hunt to kill
I'm gonna skin the hide
A yelp and scream
And away I ride

I'll never top this view
I'll never fall aground
It's all for you
For what you found

I say
I say
I say
I say

It's gonna take your hand
It's gonna drive you home
It's gonna keep on, keep on, keep on
And then forever roam.


Mary, if you want to
I'll waive my right
I'd be on the corner
Just passin' time

No I won't, ever once, make you cry
Just to kiss, oh I'll miss your goodbye
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

We'll go to the disco
We'll be a sight
Oh and we'll dance like boyfriends
It's sheer delight

Oh I won't, never once, make you cry
With the kiss, oh I miss your goodbye

Oh I won't, never once, make you cry
Just to kiss, oh and I'll miss your goodbye
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha


Strange, living with a name
They get the best of me
But I'm not walking away
I don't complain
Not that much to change
But they keep testing me
And I get beat in the face

But there they go
I'ma hit the road
And what would I care
Hell I ain't goin' nowhere
I got the rain
The curse always made up
And make a play up
So I know I'ma show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my soul

And every single girl
Sitting on a pretty thing
I ain't seekin' to have
It's safe to say
If I don't get this out of me
I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad

Cross my 'T''s
Try to dot my 'I''s
But that's just blind of me
I ain't livin' that way
I roll my sleeves
And make a better man of me
I might easily just give up on the show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my show

I must show
It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
Where I stand
It's my role
It's my show

It's my show
It's my show


I got a friend,
Shows me all the good times,
Tells me I look better,
Chews me up and spits me out,
And then walks my ass home.
And sings a song,
When I'm gone, gone, gone.

A little friend,
Shoots me up and downtown,
When I can't get me drunk enough,
To bring me out the pieces,
Of a place I call home.
To sing a song,
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone.

Gone
Gone
Gone

I've got a friend,
Help me to get up again,
Showers me in bruises,
Tells me I got a big old dick,
And she wants my asshole.
To sing a song,
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone
You know son!

Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone.


Salty leave, salty leave

Tell me the one about the friend you knew
And the last good night that we toasted too.

Salty leave,
Stay for me, stay for me

We drank wine in the matinee
And the spotlight showed what it chased away

Stay for me

She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bar tend your party

Kill me, kill me

I called and called, but I can't get through,
Said he's on his own, but his own is you

Kill me

She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bar tend your party

She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bar tend your party

(hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm hm)


Free, that's all that she could bleed
That's why she'll never stay
White, bare naked in the night
And lookin' for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world
Any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind

Slow, she's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here
You'll plead, you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when you think she's let you in
That's when she fades away

You want it
She's got it
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind
Molly's Chambers gonna change your mind

You want it
She's got it
Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol

Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
You want it
She's got it
Molly's chambers gonna change your mind
She's got your
Your pistol


My riding partner used to work for a living
He take the backseat of all that he was given
He let you rise and take the fall
He was my favorite friend of all

My old muchacho
Love to dress for each occasion
Without that rocket shell taking me in the right direction
Those crooked eyes that knew it all
Was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all

He's wearing jean on jean
Cut him some slack, Fox
Pressed to the corner of the scene
Just here to take stock
He'll take the chain
He'll take the ball
He was my favorite friend of all
He was my favorite friend of all


It's changing all to yellow
And it's carvin' a path
So now we're on our way

It's takin' us some journeys
While we wipe away frowns in the most crowded place
Say why you never call me man you never seem to call now that I'm okay
I'll beat you in the end and don't you ever turn around
cause here comes the comin' of age

Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party

A cocky look emerges as you question my mood
Cause you ain't got no taste
You talking 'bout my baby I could flip you upside down
And I could mop this place

Say why you never sorry
No you never seen my calling right in front your face
I smoke you in the end and don't you ever turn around
Cause here's that comin' of age

Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party

Oh
Oh

Oh she saw my party
Oh she saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party
Oh she saw my party
She saw my party


How many souls will it take
How many necks will you break
I say, how many bones can I waste
In that little old shape
I say, hey, I'm sober from a bar
But you don't drive me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Gonna tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sober from a bar
But you don't drive me
Show you my car
But I don't drive

Tell the idiot yeah
Running down my back
We could, see the devils in town
Like the slow fall down
I say, hey, I'm sober from a bar
But you don't drive me
I showed you my car
But I don't drive
I said, hey, I'm taken it back
Like you don't know
You drove me away
When you don't know

Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Gonna tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sober from a bar
But you don't drive me
Show you my car
But I don't drive

Wants to kill me something
He wants to kill me off of the street
Don't wipe my tongue
Or spread me up and break me a fever
Give me something I can believe in
Give me something to walk me away
I'm a waste of time
And all they are a waste of a living
Waste of a living

Can't you see me walking the hall
I've been down to the haunted back
And I'm way too tired
Of blowing out the burning candle
I got no money but I want you so
I got no money but I want you so
I got so much I can not handle
Can not handle
I can not handle

And I'm just pissing around
Cut me loose of this fucking town
I ain't coming back
I got my ticket on to the next one
I got no money but I want you so
I got no money but I want you so
And I want and I want and I want and I want it


I got a notion to say what doesn't feel right
Got an answer in your story today
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

I just wanted to know if I could go home
Been rambling in day after day
And everyone says I don't know

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

Got a notion to say what doesn't feel right
I just wanted to know if I could go home

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before

So don't knock it, don't knock it
So don't knock it, don't knock it

So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it, you've been here before


She said call me now baby,
And I'd come a running,
She said call me now baby,
And I'd come a running,
If you'd call me now baby,

There's this boy I know who's afraid of the ocean
Never quite found love he drank the love potion
I'll be on the chain smoking in the basement
Shattered like the windows

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

Find my bag of bones at the back of the station
Said make yourself at home
So I started day drinking
'Til I believe in time after seven, eight or nine
You fall yourself to pieces

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend

I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend


I see the grass beneath me
I smell the winter sky
And think to myself
Don't pass me by
You dance in strange conditions with strangers of the night
I see you're crazy and so am I

You bled out red and blue
The boys of NYU, they saw you coming from miles away
Nothing is quite as homey, we dive in sunny days
I see you Kenny, you castaway

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over, anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over, anymore

Bright lights, that made the city
Quaaludes on Christmas Eve and all the good times we've ever seen
The roles we played together
The slaps across my face
My face brings new reason you write the scene?

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

My angel hovers over
The light comes crashing in
I know it's how this here story ends
I'll hang around forever, until you cut me down
I'm crossed and ready to face the crowd

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore

Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say is over anymore
Oh, don't say it's over
Don't say it's over anymore


Walk you home to see
Where you're living around
And I know this place
Pour yourself on me
And you know I'm the one
That you won't forget

In your den always
I see something's right
When I see your wink
When he comes around
I see you're fixing the shine
And my face won't speak

Hate to be so emotional
I didn't mean to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said you call that a pickup truck
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
A kicking, screaming, a rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know I was oh

Trembling knees are weak
And its cold as a hole
Hug your bones and skin
Crackling wood's gone white
And my eyes swolled up now
I can see the light

Hate to be so emotional
I didn't mean to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said you call that a pickup truck
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
A kicking, screaming, a rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know I oh
Just so you know I oh
Just so you know I oh

I hate to be so emotional
I didn't mean to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said you call that a pickup truck
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
A kicking, screaming, a rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know I oh
Just so you know I oh


Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire

Shattered the frame
Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One in the same
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crows

I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's gonna tickle
You're gonna giggle
It's gonna tickle
Tickle for free
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crows


I got a razor sharp mind that wants to cut you down.
A little place in mind and baby I could let you down.
Pony up, we got a ways to go.
Set me up my friends are running low.
Oh, oh, oh

If you take my hand I'm gonna get you outta here.
The crush of bottles break another swinging chandelier.
In a round of bullets and blood and smoke,
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go.
Oh, oh, oh

In a round of bullets and blood and smoke,
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go.
Yeah I watched her go.
I watched her
I watched her go.
I watched her go.


A single book of matches gonna burn what's standing in the way.
Roaring down the mountain, they're calling on the fire brigade.
Carry out the pictures and tell the kids that I'm okay.
If'n I'm forgotten, you'll remember me for the day.

I won't ever be your cornerstone.
I

All the black inside me is slowly seeping from the bone.
Everything I cherish is slowly dying or it's gone.
Little shaking babies and drunkards seem to all agree,
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see.

I won't ever be your cornerstone.
I don't want to be here holding on.
I won't ever be your cornerstone.
I

Watch her run, can you feel it?
Watch her run, can you feel it?
Watch her run, can you feel it?
Watch her run, can you feel it?

I won't ever be your cornerstone.
I don't want to be here holding on.
I won't ever be your cornerstone.
I


When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there

It's in the water
It's where you came from
It's in the water
It's where you came from

And the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face

It's in the water...
It's in the story
It's where you came from
The sons and daughters
In all their glory
It's gonna shape them
And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from
Where you came from

You're the rose
That was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away

It's in the water
It's in the story
It's where you came from
The sons and daughters
In all their glory
It's gonna shape them
And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from
Where you came from

And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from
Where you came from




I want to say it's to me to change the world
And I wanna play till they kicking down the doors
And I'll be alright as long as I ain't seen it all
And I'ma hold you tight to that night we had a ball
We had a ball

Here's to the kids out there smoking in the streets
They're way too young but I'm way too old to preach
They know it all but they still ain't seen the truth
Just play my song and I'll show it all to you

Either way you caught me with your lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down

My papa's slave had to go and fight the war
He'd beat 'em all then he took 'em all to court
My papa called and he said do you remember me
Now he's working awful hard at his factory

Either way you caught me with your lyin'
You caught me whilst a lyin'
You caught me with my pants down

We hang even into the ocean
We been running barefoot this spring
We been running barefoot through this spring
We hang even into the ocean

(We ain't even been to the ocean
We been running barefoot in the stream
We been running barefoot through this street
We hang even into the ocean)


Just like the girlies back at corner store
Wash my bugle boy a watching my throne
Sweet mutilation of a sold to nothing man
Lord have mercy shake is falling through your hand
Razz the kid
Because she love me I'm the chosen one
These are the days to not be having fun
I listen back to what you told me before,
Just tell me where to come, I'll knock down the door
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid
Razz the kid


You know you could've been a wonder
Takin' your circus to the sky
You couldn't take it on the tight rope
No you had to take it on the side
You always like it undercover
Tucked in between your dirty sheets
But no one's even done nuttin' to ya
In between the hollers and the screams

And I said nah nah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light

You got your cozy little corner
All night you're jammin' on your feet
Hangin' out just like a street sign
And put a twenty dollar trick
I hear you're blowin' like a feather
And then they rub it in your face
Oh once they've had all their fun hun
You're at the bottom of the cage

And I said nah nah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
And I said nah nah hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right

Hey hey another dirty bird ain't givin' out a taste
Uh hey keep on givin' away and givin' it away (givin' it away)
Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
Hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away

Ah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
And I said nah nah hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away
That's not right

And I said nah nah hey hey
Another dirty bird ain't giving out a taste
In the black of the night till the red morning light
And I said nah nah hey hey you're givin' all your cinnamon away


On a plane, on a plane
Off to see the city girls again
Only bringing what to carry on,
So that you know I won't be long
Dripping beard as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail

Honestly I can see
The giggling virgin overlooking me
Trying to put together what to say
Although it wouldn't matter anyway
Dripping beard as cold as hell
And the motherfuckers gonna go to jail

This Rememo is set for home
It's personal but they need to know

I'm overdue another round,
To gain control and take me down
You're all tied up as you should be
And I'll be cutting out naturally
Dripping beards as cold as jail
And the motherfuckers gonna go to hell

This Rememo is set for home
It's personal but they need to know


What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancing machine
With the fire in my bones, and the sweet taste of kerosene
I get lost in the light, so high don't wanna come down
To face the loss of the good thing, that I have found

In the dark of the night I can hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if your ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

See the time we shared it was precious to me
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry

Gonna run baby run like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind at my back I won't ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
But the demon in me was the best of friends from the start

So the time we shared it was precious to me
All the while I was dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry

And I told myself for the way you go, it rained so hard it felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods in the dark of the night
Palest of the old moonlight
Everything just felt so incomplete

Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry


On the limb cut down in the middle of the night caught in a trap
Cursed by the crown of the wandering man who was never coming back
Stuck on the line spinning all of his time with his back to the throne
With the flash of the round everybody in town said leave me alone

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

I got caught in the middle of a hurricane fight facing the ground
Beast to the wild with the porcelain smile as it passes around
The truth in the skies from the billowing eyes isn't working on me
Don't you think you gotta give me
Give me something I want
Give me something I need

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
Your heart will never say so
Your heart will never let you go
Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go

Just like a reverend, like a reverend on the radio
My heart will never say so
My heart will never let you go


I was running through the desert, I was looking for drugs
And I was searching for a woman who was willing to love
So I could take her like a woman
Yeah take her like a woman

I was looking for a bad girl, looking for a bad boy
Someone who could take all the night away
Oh baby I could shake it like a woman
Yeah shake it like a woman

I got the eyes on me
Of a jealous man, and if you're looking to run, well then you've already ran
I break down like a woman
I break down like a woman

I'll go back to Rock City,
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me

I've been several miles and plenty more,
And I found myself face-first on the floor
Searching for something
But never finding something

And I don't know where I belong,
I'm just trying to get myself back home
And get a little work
Yeah find my little woman

And I'll go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me

Oh my my, oh my my, oh my my
I need to find something
I'm searching for something

I'll go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me

I'll go back to Rock City,
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me


Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
Watching

All the commotion
The kiddie like play
It has people talking
Talking

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying

You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire

Hot as a fever
Rattle of bones
I could just taste it
Taste it

But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire

Consumed
With what's to transpire

And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire


Slow nights so long she's frenching out flavour
She's seventeen but I done went and plum forgot it.

No tears are gone they're pooling on the table
No tears are gone they're leaving their mark behind

So far so good she's absolutely wasted.
She's hanging up and changing her story around

I just don't know where leading ladies come from
I just don't where they can be found

She's opening up just like she really knows me
I hate her face but enjoy the company

I'll take you home, to back to Oklahoma
You're not so nice but the sex sells so cheap

Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor poor boys

Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor poor boys

Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor poor boys

Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers


I used to see you every day
I used to see you every day
I danced around your folk and soul
I danced to all your fucking soul
I left you with your nose a bleedin'
And your toes a creepin' around
Ah so mundane and incomplete
Hand my down my pants and get me off this street

I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but I'm soft

Behind the fringe of a whiskey high
Mutilating cat like eyes
And in your nose blood decadence
You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing
You paint my fingers and you paint my toes
You let your perfect nipple show

I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but I'm soft
But I'm soft

I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but I'm soft

I'm passed out in your garden
I'm in I can't get off so soft
I'd pop myself in your body
I'd come into your party, but I'm soft


Spiral staircase going down, paint your body red and brown
On our knees we'll feast on a sex show
Spiral staircase spiral staircase

Greasy haircuts a German Chinese girl
Gonna keep ya'll busy tugging at my curl
Get your ass together
You better walk, walk, walk by walking we cannot run

They all came to the party and there's four to every stall
Get's fust-er-ating just pissin' on this wall
Seems like there's another story bangin'
Around every step you fake

Spiral staircase going down, paint your body red and brown

My motivation is going to soon, good vibrations all over you,
Act like you mean it, you mean it,
You gotta story you never tell, down in the delta ringing bells,
I've never seen it, seen it
Back of my mind I'm on my way, I see through smiles on every face
I don't believe it, believe it

Cause' I'm a Supersoaker red and white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away

The flags are flying across the plains
I got a secret picking in my brain
I wanna see you, see you
Yes, the sign is on my face
Don't know my home, I don't know my place
I just wanna be there, be there

'Cause I'm the Supersoaker, red white and blew 'em all away
With the kisses unclean as the words that you say

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, whoa oh oh

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
I just lay it on the line, on the line

I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, walk away
I don't mind sentimental girls at times
Miss don't walk away, oh oh oh oh


Weeds blow tall on a broken train track
Ruth B. draws, we're fixin' to get high
Maybe we'll hit the bluffs
And find ourselves the same old rum

But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly

Life goes by on a Talihina sky
The hopped up boys are lookin' for their trouble
The knocked up girls, well, they've all got their share
Ruth seems out of her mind, swears she won't give in this time

But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly

Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky

But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be gettin' out as soon as I can fly

Life goes by on a Talihina sky
Life goes by on a Talihina sky


Aha shake taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake black as night on a Sunday

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

Heartbreak knockin' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak, cigarettes and songs, with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter and a run away

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

Aha shake tapered jean girl kills me

Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher


The dance floor's a temptress
Can't make out what your saying

But you rub me the right way
With your child-like persuasion

I got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
She'll find I'm a simple
Stone washed up and so slow

I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you

I feel all amiss now
I'm tossed in the scatter
And your eyes keep on shifting,
To the boys that don't matter
I've got my hands in my pockets
I'm still crossing my fingers

I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you

I've got my hands in my pockets
And I'm crossing my fingers
I just want to be noticed
I just want to be noticed

I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you
I'd take one in the temple
I'd take one for you oh
I'd take one in the temple (temple)
I'd take one for you


I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
Three in the morning, come a-bang-bang-bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait
Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two

Eighteen, balding, star
Golden, fallen heart

Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk, your Japanese scream
It's been too long since I've left the shed
You kick the bucket, I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die, but old is the grave

Eighteen, balding, star
Golden, fallen heart

I'ma gonna show the way.
I'ma gonna show the way.
I'ma gonna show the way.
I'ma gonna show the way.

Eighteen, balding, star


Running with the streetlights,
Laughing in the grave
He swears he's gonna give it up, it's never gonna be enough
I just wanna be there when you're all alone, thinkin' 'bout a better day,
When you had it in your bones

This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end

I see you in the evening, sitting on your throne.
Prayin' with a fireball, and posted up against the wall
I just wanna hold you, take you by your hands and tell you that you're good enough,
And tell you that it's gonna be tough

This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I ain't got a home

Runnin' from the streetlights
Shinin' on a grave
Once you had the good stuff, never gonna fill you up
I wanna be the one who gives them all the world
And gives em all the feelin' of it, just a little taste of it

This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
This could be the end
'Cause I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam, no I ain't got a home
Out there all alone
I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
No I ain't got a home
I'll forever roam
I ain't got a home


Beneath the dance hall lights,
You seem a girl so sound
Lights up the ground,
If you give up New York,
I'll give you Tennessee,
The only place to be

The cowboy's burning eyes,
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight, enough to breathe
I like your point of view,
So don't you shy away

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave

You had me holding on
All of the time in place
Ride out the wave
Bury yourself away
The one and only face

Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave


The open road, the path of greatness
It's at your fingers
Go be the one that keeps on fighting
Go be the stranger
Just put your foot in front' the other
Crow like a rooster
We are allowed to get us something
Fear as a danger

I say

Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face

The windows are
The perfect picture
They're always changin'
Go on get lost
Jump in the waters
When they are raging
I said

Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone

Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone


Hard times as we go
We know what times will change
I talked to Jesus
Jesus says I'm okay

Pushin' and jumpin'
Jumpin' the mountain range
And in a railroad
Railroad from Hell to Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacin' on the phone
Sneakin' on the train come back

Awful sick and tired of the gang
She comes from nothing
Hopin' for a taste of fame
She's got a birthmark
A birthmark the shape of Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacin' on the phone
Sneakin' on the train come back

Awful sick and tired of the gang
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle
Cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle

Hard times as we go
We know where times will change
I talk to Jesus
Jesus everyday

(Hard times as we go)


Tonight, somebody's lover
Is gonna pay for a sin
It's coming on, it's coming on
I don't know, just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming on, it's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way

Well my seat, lights on Broadway
I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming on, it's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way

A hole in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
And it's something along the way
There's something along the way

Tonight, gonna leave my body
Tonight, gonna leave my body

Tonight, somebody's lover
Is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming on, it's coming on

I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way

A hole in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights the way
And it's something along the way
There's something along the way

Gonna leave my body
Tonight, gonna leave my body


Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys?
Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers


Dirty belly of a secret town
Cheap trick hookers that are hanging out at the bar
In the Greyhound station
And the bare-chested boys are going down
On every thing that the momma believes
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine
Help you feel not so strange

Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
'Cause all tied to the chair
I said, lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten

All the bubbas got their heads in a nod
They don't know what they love or deserve to get
Chances are they tab their worm in a slab
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight
ah tonight, tonight, tonight

Ah maybe tonight
Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to the chair
I said, lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten
Comes home on call, isn't that the peace
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth
Spitting out his teeth

Comes home on call, isn't that the peace
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth
Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line
Hands all tied to the chair
I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten

I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound
Like a tranny on a ten

I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound

Oh oh oh oh ho oh
Oh oh oh oh ho oh

I want in like a substitute
I've been working awful hard for you
But you don't say, you just hold your breath
So I can't touch what I haven't yet
She's a cold one and it hurts me so
And it's a dark path and a heck of a cold
And she can feel me just like she did before

Oh we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home

Push in and I pull it away
It's a hard part but the true love way
Girl you want it like I want it now
With your smart mouth and your killer hands
We could both share all that I have made
For a young man it's a heck of a wage
And I feel crazy when I see your face

Oh oh oh oh ho oh

'Cause we'd be so free (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
Happy alone (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
Sharing a smile (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
So far from home (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
And we would laugh (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
Laugh till we cried (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
Making a song (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)
Making a lie (Oh oh oh oh ho oh)

And people say I'm crazy for walking this town
And people say I'm bigger for walking this town
And people say maybe they're just wandering around
And people say I'm bigger for walking a'

Oh oh oh oh ho oh
Oh oh oh oh ho oh
Oh oh oh oh ho oh
Oh oh oh oh ho oh

And we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cried
Making a song
Making a lie
Happy alone


Well I got
What she wants
Ah her nose
A tied knot
I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

Well she got
What I want
And she knows
What I'm not
And I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

She sang
Whoo

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street

You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody

Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody
Someone like you, somebody

I've been roaming around,
Always looking down at all I see


Walking like you're sucking velvet snow
Walking like you're sucking velvet snow
Starting on your story and go go
Oh walking like you're sucking velvet snow

Going 'cause you're sweating on our floor
Going 'cause you're sweating on our floor
Acting like you've never dance no more
Oh going 'cause you're sweating on our floor

Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Showing off you're Sunday shaved and lacy
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face

Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

And then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

Little Jo she warned me mot to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city that you came from


Gonna open my heart, out of the scars and listen up
Gonna do what I'm told, though I'm told and listen up
Take a shot in the rain, one for the pain and listen up
I traveled the way

Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

Gonna soften the blow, soften the blow and give it up
I saw the surprise, the look in your eyes, I gave it up
Gonna be who I am, be who I am, and give it up
I traveled the way

Wait for me, wait for me
It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me

It's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me
Oh, it's all better now, it's all better now
Wait for me, wait for me


I can get there on my own
You can leave me here alone
I'm just tryin' to do what's right
Oh, a man ain't a man unless he's fought the fight

I could never point you out
Waste of space in a faceless crowd
Tell me what I have to say
If you know what's right then you'll walk away

When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

One by one I'm seein' them fall
Some just don't show up at all
I'm just here to fight the fire
Oh, a man ain't a man unless he has desire

And the walls come down
And the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
You threw it away
A Western girl with Eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there's nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way

When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down
When the walls come down

You tore out my heart
You threw it away
Western girl with Eastern eyes
Took a wrong turn and found surprise awaits
Now there's nothing in the way
In the way
In the way
In the way


All the way from Waco to WE-HO with a rabbit on her chain
Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain
She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame
Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Sexy was her boyfriend, with no kin, always running from the law
Every other weekend, the week ends with his back at her claw
He's a live wire, wired, shooting sparks in the night
He's a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven

Oh, take the time to waste a moment
Oh, face it where the lines are broken
Oh, name a price to all that's living
Oh, never ask to be forgiven


It's your life
Don't you let em tell you when to bat your eyes
You're the only one who's gonna sacrifice
Makes no difference if you're right or wrong
Take that ride
But I want your little sister by your side
Maybe little later we can all collide
Do our lovin' like a rollin' stone
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

Innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be

Show your face
Livin' in the shadows like you got no name
Enough to make a little girly go insane
Be my guest to let it out tonight
It's ok
I know all about the little games you play
Shakin' your apple right in my face
Only when you know that I'm beggin' for a bite
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted

Innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be

Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is wasted time
Time on me is
I'm gonna get your mama, I'm gonna get your pa
I'm gonna everybody, just a what I saw

So won't you show your face (show your face)
Your little apple shake (show your face)
I know the love you gave (show your face)
I know the love you take (show your face)

Innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be

Innocent smile
Runnin' free
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be
Baby's gonna give it like it used to be


Put your hands in the air
You look like the girl from the fair with the bubbly eyes
Stood and watched you, pulling at a rock,
But her rock don't compromise
Come up to me say why are you so skinny I'm pretty for a boy
Said thanks for the insult and complement
Y'all never forget my face no more

I can hardly beat you 
And I know it's getting harder to beat you 
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it'll take a little second to break you 
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows

Looking pretty pinks
Sitting on a swing
That don't mean a thing at all
The heels of my feets are barking like a pack of dogs
Skinning with a cone what I saw
Take it for your word 
Take it for a ride
Take it for the evening dead or alive
Warming up the car packin us some powder to play

I can hardly beat you 
And I know it's getting harder to beat you 
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it'll take a little second to break you 
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows

Jessica

Head like a stone 
Stoned like a rock
Clogging up your nose again
Poppa's are searching 
Devil was a knocking 
Juice swimming over my face 
Here it goes now


In your little white wicker chair
Unsuspicious nobody cares for you
You're so fucked up again
You laugh at nothin' in the pouring rain
Try to tell yourself you're not insane
You fool, I hate you sometimes

Hey, you know it ain't coincidental that you're lost in place
It's drippin' off your face, and you're losin' your precious mind

Send me a postcard if you get that far
You got a couple pennies in your rusty jar
The truth you've been gone for awhile
It's hard lookin' at you when you look that way
With your one night stands and your sleep all days
Ooh you're such a slut sometimes

Hey, you know it ain't coincidental that you're lost in place
It's drippin' off your face, and you're losin' your precious mind

You're losing your mind


Locked in a mainstream melody
Oh, I wanna take you in
If you come around, I come a running
Once through the fire again
The weather, the wind is picking up
Every little string is you
Plucked from the vine, ahead of its time
Only if you want me to

Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open

Spent the night on a riverside
Trying to recall my name
Head full of pins, I'm sinking in
Something hasn't gone insane
The step of the light comes screamin' in
Harsh enough to see it through
Something in the air and the water tonight
Rising from the depths of you

Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open

Wild, my breath of wonder
Child, running like thunder
Brace for the explosion
Wild is for the open


Love the days 
She's gone for the moment 
I don't know which way she was going 
Lord, it's been 
A long warm November 
I know now 
She acts like her mother 

I've been holding on 
Here forever 
And I don't know where she's gone 
But hopefully 
She knows not to come back now 

Kick in the door, get on the floor 
Went on a woman prowl (Woo Hoo) 
Something to kiss the night away
When I'm taking back that (Woo Hoo) 
Baby you know that I can hold my own
When I'm feeling (Woo Hoo) 
Baby, you know, that I could just sail away 

Gone away
So gone in the moment
Still can't tell which way she was going
Shaping up 
And growing right on me 
Taking my advice 
Like her father

I've been holding on 
Here forever 
And I don't know where she's gone 
But hopefully she knows not to turn around

Kick in the door, get on the floor 
Went on a woman prowl (Woo Hoo) 
Something to kiss the night away
When I'm taking back that (Woo Hoo) 
Baby you know that I can hold my own
When I'm feeling (Woo Hoo) 
Baby, you know, that I could just sail away

She's going to prowl when the storm comes 
And it'll come, and it'll come, and it'll come 
Instead she says, "Can't get none".


Rise and shine
Get on your way
By the look in your eyes there's nothing to say
I got it all
In my hands
And I know that you know just where I stand
Where we stand

One more thing
Before you go
Pick it up and then I'll hit it on down the road
I got no time
For playing games
I mean that I'm out and it's always the same
It's always the same

Ooo, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get on my coat and leave

No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work on me
I said that before
I open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?

Pick that guitar
Up in the air
Cut it loose and then let down that hair
I know that you
Were born to shine
You got a shine before you're blown away
You're blown away

Ooo, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh what a shame
If this is all the same
I'll get on my coat and leave

No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work on me
I said that before
I open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?/

Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way

I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
Get on your way
Oh what a shame
If it's all the same
Get on your way

No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
Get on your way
I told you before
I open the door
Get on your way

Get on your way


I don't think that I want to die
And for this I need a reason why
When you humans act so funny and I need to fill my tummy
I tried
I lied
I don't know why I act this way
Something seems to change from day to day
I'm feeling kinda silly and my mood seems kinda fitting
I tried
I lied
But through the waves I'll find...
I don't feel like a man today
All good themes have been blown away
When I'm feelin' kinda goddy and my mood seems kinda fitting
I tried
I lied
But through the waves I'll find...
some peace of mind
I'll ride you out



Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to question the hand that I hold close
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I have to silence the words that you fear most

Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
We're at the end of a burning tightrope

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
'Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Together I know, together I know
That we'd burn like a rocket's afterglow
Together I know, together I know
We could conquer the stars beyond this world

We let it all go, we let it all go
I'm just a voice on a broken radio
We let it all go, we let it all go
We got lost in the constellations

Now I'm waiting on the corner in the back of your mind
It's a lonely place to live, and I got nowhere to hide
'Cause you told me that you'd never be afraid of heights again
Nobody ever thought that we could make it this high
You're the only one I'd follow 'til the end of time
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

And after all these years, and all of this time
Darling, if I'm still a question in your mind
Just say the words and this will end

You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me we should never be afraid of heights again
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
You told me that you'd never be afraid of heights 
If we fall, we fall together baby, don't think twice again

Wherever I go, wherever I go
I hear your voice on a broken radio
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I know we'll burn like a rocket's afterglow
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
So are we destined to hit the ground below?
Don't ever let go, don't ever let go
Are we just watching the final chapter close?


Do it again, she said to me, so I nailed my hand to the baseboard floor 
Hysterically, laughing at me, she begged the question and I begged for more 
Now I water, the thorn you rammed, deep into my side watch it fertalize 
Cause you shoved your finger, right down my throat, and you make me puke up all of my pride 
Pop the Beach Balls, burn the photos 
C-4 your safe, and you'll never grow old 
So get out of dodge, and become a thought 
Cause once you're a thought, hopefuly you're forgot 
If we break up, don't write a song, that would drag my name through the shit, the mud 
Cause I've seen some solid swimmers who drowned, when you unleashed the dam and caused the flood 
But with free choice, there comes freewill, and I'm so happy she decided to leave 
Cause now I'm alone, the demons come home, and now my pen is rolling up it's sleeve 
Pop the Beach Balls, burn the photos 
C-4 your safe, and you'll never grow old 
So get out of dodge, and become a thought 
Cause once you're a thought, hopefuly you're forgot 
Pop the Beach Balls, burn the photos 
C-4 your safe, and you'll never grow old 
So get out of dodge, and become a thought 
Cause once you're a thought, hopefuly you're forgot 
Because my morals have begun to decay, and all my friends have the same thing to say 
They say that good times have faded away, they say that their all worried about me 
Cause I feed birds in the cemetery, and I rake leaves off the grass in my grave 
Because my memory lain is now paved 
Nothing wrong 
My memory lain is now paved 
There's nothing wrong 
My memory lain is now paved 
Nothing wrong 
My memory lain is now paved 
There's nothing wrong 
But now my memory's back and there's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong 
I said there's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong 
There's nothing wrong


Brothers in arms who share my fears,
Time to protect what you hold dear
There's been a rise in new ideals,
Threatening to change the way we live

Who knows what trouble's found a way,
Found a way to your door today
Who knows what trouble's on its way,
On its way to intimidate

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
'Cause this is my right no matter the cost
Get outta my sight when baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
Baby's got a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh

Pride is a weapon in your hand
Freedom awards the faithful man
I hear the message loud and clear,
Straight from his lips into my ear

And lord I just can't walk away,
Walk away from the enemy
The law will never disagree,
On the target of my insecurities

All I want is a big red gun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot at the setting sun
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh
And all I want is a big red gun,
I'm gonna shoot, shoot, shoot till the thrill is gone
And how many lives will have to be lost to understand why my baby's got a big red gun?

(Baby's got a big red gun)

We call them twisted and deranged (baby's got a big red gun)
But we gave them the keys to annihilate (baby's got a big red gun)
How long before the next one's in the ground? (Baby's got a big red gun)
So proud of all your history (baby's got a big red gun)
But history made a big mistake (baby's got a big red gun)
The judge and jury stand before you now (baby's got a big red gun)

'Cause baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Baby's got a big red gun
Oh momma what have I become?


Lay down, lay down with your drunken fools
I never thought you could be so cruel
And all the rumors I heard were true
You had another man in our room
Peel off the bandages from the wounds
I still have plenty of scars to prove
I'm sick of covering up the truth
So now I'm taking it back from you

From the start, 
Drew a target on my heart
So you can throw your poison darts
You'll never kill, never kill...

You left the trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And you keep tearing them apart
With bloody nails and broken hearts

Now I know fairy tales don't come true
When Cinderella don't fit the shoe
Someday I'll get back the love I gave
Someday you'll pay for the mess you've made

From the start, 
Drew a target on my heart
So you can throw your poison darts
You'll never kill, never kill...

You left the trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And you keep tearing them apart
With bloody nails and broken hearts

You left the trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And I bet you thought I'd miss
Your bitter kiss

Your bitter kiss
Your bitter kiss
I'll never miss your bitter kiss
Your bitter kiss
Your bitter kiss
I'll never miss your bitter kiss

So now I'm taking it back from you
(So now I'm taking it back from you)
And now I'm taking it back from you

You left the trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And you keep tearing them apart
With bloody nails and broken hearts

You left the trail right from the start
Of bloody nails and broken hearts
And I bet you thought I'd miss 
Your bitter kiss

Your bitter kiss
Your bitter kiss


In a garage, beside a house, there is a luxury sedan
And for his next monthly installment,
He's gonna go out with a bang!

Boy who always did what he was told,
Was promised to be king when he was old

Hit the brakes, hit the glass,
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past,
Flashed before his face

There is a man, intensive care
When he awakes he will declare,
"I've been dead for twenty years!
I won't let twenty more go by"
Boy who always did what he was told,
Bought the only dream that he was sold

Hit the brakes, hit the glass,
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past,
Flashed before his face

Burn the evidence, of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence, of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Ever feel like you've been cheated,
Following what they believe?
Don't shake the hands of fate,
Don't shake the hands of fate,
There's no more time to waste!

Burn the evidence, of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence, of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence!
Don't shake the hands of fate,
There's no more time to waste!


We try to stay young, by chasing the sun
You blink for too long, the swans sing a song
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes and they're gone

After all we've been told, we're still flesh and bone
And life's worth much more than silver and gold
And all that I've lost, and all that I've won
Don't mean nothing more when you open your eyes and they're gone

And how could it be that we'll never see
The first day of spring and the last autumn leaves?
So lost in my mind, I try to stay strong
If wounds heal in time, tell me why it's so hard to move on

Hard to move on
I'll never move on

I curse the mistakes that we'll never make
The pictures of trips that we'll never take
And all of these thoughts, they keep me awake
Hang on to your heroes before it's too late
'Cause there'll come a time when you open your eyes and they're gone

Some day they're gone
Some day they'll be gone

And I'll still be here chasing the sun


Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky

My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead

Cold turkey has got me on the run

My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone

My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze

Cold turkey has got me on the run

Cold turkey has got me on the run

Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again

Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell

Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey
Cold turkey
Got me on the run
Cold turkey


Twisted tongues will place you in their category
Face to face you'll hear them tell a different story
Loose lips may sink ship, but honesty's forever
Eye's of envy try to cut and try to sever

Cowards that hide behind their words!
Don't care whose feelings will get hurt
Beware the voice without a face
That's hidden underneath the

Covered of Cowardice! (Can't you see them?!)

That's hidden underneath the
Covered of Cowardice! (Can't you see them?!)
Covered of Cowardice! (Can't you hear them?!)
Cowards that hide behind their words!
Don't care whose feelings will get hurt

Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face

When your insecure, they'll find the fuel to start a fire
They're bitter pricks with only hatred to inspire

Level heads prevail, revenge won't make it better
Trust your instinct like you trust what's in the mirror

Cowards that hide behind their words!
Don't care whose feelings will get hurt
Beware the voice without a face
That's hidden underneath the

Covered of Cowardice! (Can't you see them?!)
Covered of Cowardice! (Can't you hear them?!)

Crooked minds have gone astray
Have they never learned from yesterday? 
Only a fool would wear the crown
One day the kids will tear it down

Yeah

Can't you see the clocks are ticking away? 
They try to fit more hours into the day
To see that you was crunching numbers away
We're running out breath just to keep up the pace

And when did the revolver start the race? 
When did the revolver start the race? 

Accelerated architecture creates
A manufactured lifestyle for the deranged
They swallow up the green and build up the gray
And like tomorrows kids, dispose of today

And when d'you think the roots will buy them out? 
When d'you think the roots will buy them out? 

Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'til something dies
(the kids will tear it down)
'Til something dies
(the kids will tear it down)

Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Til the ground touches the sky
(the kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky
(the kids will tear it down)

Cemetery statue stare into space
Sucked into a social media craze
They're looking for an answer to explain
The reason why disaster strikes again

A picture perfect family sits by the lake
Swimming in a sea of mechanical waste
And can't they see a tragedy awaits? 
Can't they see a tragedy awaits? 

Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'til something dies
(the kids will tear it down)
'Til something dies
(the kids will tear it down)

Crooked minds ain't satisfied
'Til the ground touches the sky
(the kids will tear it down)
Touches the sky
(the kids will tear it down)

We'll tear it down

Hope can't arise these bloodshot eye
Tangled in their power lines
Tear the ground up with their lives
Raise the caskets in the sky
Someday soon they'll realize
Nothing's left for you and I
Nothing's left for you and I

Crooked minds have gone astray
Have they never learned from yesterday? 
Only a fool would wear the crown
One day the kids will tear it down

Crooked minds under gray skies
They can't live 'til something dies
(the kids will tear it down)
'Til something dies

Time drifts through the sky
Without a reason why
We walk past the flowers
Don't stop for a breath
Until they're above our heads

We used to fight
Have we made amends?
Father I just can't tell
Watching you spent the time you have left
Trapped in a cold blue bed

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

We said that we would call
But we never spoke at all
The years drifted by
We've built up these walls
For reasons that seem so small
If this is the end, let's bury the past
This might be our one last chance
Together until the last grain of sand
Has dropped from the hourglass

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to pray
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy
All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

All those you've loved
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
All those you've loved
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

So open your eyes
Open your eyes and don't forget to pray
If we lose the fight
If we lose the fight your spirit will live through me
It's time we make right
It's time we make right the pages of history
Until we find
Until we find a cure for the enemy

In darkness we'll rest
Count the days down to one last breath
In darkness we'll rest
So forgive what you can't forget

(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(Count the days down to one last breath)
All those who've died
All we have left is what lives in our minds
(In darkness we'll rest)
All those you've loved
(So forgive what you can't forget)
All those who've died
I know their spirits are up in the sky

In darkness we'll rest


Oh my girl
Your so hot when you walk you melt snow
And now that disco has finally grown old
Lets buy back our souls
So lets see
Ya we've got five bucks between you and me
My mental dishes are finally clean
So cleared are we

Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission's a mission on it's own
The intermission's a mission on it's own

Now here seems our wax wings have melted away
And we've only been here for one day
My faith fades away 
So don't be a grey cloud when there's none in the sky
We found there's no hidden treasure to find
At least we tried

Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission is a mission on it's own
The intermission is a mission on it's own
So dry your rain checks you can't put time on them
So dry your rain checks you can't put time on them
Grab your suitcase we don't have time to fold
Grab your suitcase we don't have time to fold

There is no doubt you throw your in box out
There is no doubt you throw your in box out
There is no doubt you throw your in box out
There is no doubt you throw your in box out

Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
Cut the curtains the actors have gone home
The intermission is a mission on it's own
The intermission is a mission on it's own
So dry your rain checks you can't put time on them
So dry your rain checks you can't put time on them
Grab your suitcase you don't have time to fold 
Grab your suitcase you don't have time to fold 
We don't have no time to fold
We don't have no time to fold
we don't have no time to fold


We're living underneath the land of sorrow
I can hear the bombs rain down
And how do I explain there's no tomorrow
I can hardly make a sound

Dead silence
I think we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

They're marching up the main street
As my heart beats
Louder then machine gun fire
The sound of all the sirens sing like violins
Rattling the coil of wire
I heard the solders say
"Don't let them get away"
But I could not escape their bullets and grenades
A causality of war
A victim of mistake
Another widow has been made

Dead silence
Will come to and rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
I think we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

Dead silence
Will come to and rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
No time to be afraid
My love
I will see
You again

Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Fly away like the wind
Some things God can't forgive
Why is war just a fight
While the innocent die

They can tear us apart
I'll still live in your heart
If your spirit gives up
Don't surrender your love

And the world will survive
If we stand side by side
One day hope will arrive
Now I must say goodbye

Dead silence
Will come to and rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
I think we can't escape
'Til death
Do us part
In the end

Dead silence
Will come to and rescue me
When violence
Has took this world away
Dead silence
No time to be afraid
My love
I will see
You again

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence

Dead silence
When violence
Dead silence


Won't you stop, take a breath
Find a moment to reflect
On the pure and simple choices that we fail to see

From the worst to the best
From the east coast to the West
On a neverending quest to end our misery

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)

(Definition of destiny)

Punch the clock to a own
While our lives are put on hold
When did all our childhood dreams begin to disappear?

Well a long time ago
We had passion, we had goals
Why is life so set in stone it doesn't have to be?

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)

Oh get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown.

Along the way, we lost our way
So will you change or stay the same?
So in between, reality
And fantasy is destiny

So cut to the chase, it's time to escape
Before it's too late
Yeah pick up the pace, catch up with fate
It's slipping away
So get off my road, no I won't be told
'Cause I got my own (definition of destiny)
Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)

Yeah take back control, and don't let it go,
The future's unknown (definition of destiny)
'Cause I got my own
Yeah I got my own
Yeah I got my own(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)
(definition of destiny)


A devil in a midnight mass,
He prayed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive but now I'm singing

Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent knight at the edge of your knife
(Forgive me father)
Won't make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
(You're guilty!)

A devil in a midnight mass
Killed the boy inside the man
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins

Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears don't work no more
Put my trust in god that day
Not the man that got his way
I was alive but now I'm singing

Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
(Forgive me father!)
Won't make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent knight at the edge of your knife
(You're guilty!)

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made it's in the ground

Whisper, whisper don't make a sound
Your bed is made and it's in the ground


As I get closer, my dreams get farther
I climb the ladder, but you kick it over
Thirsty for water, you give me vinegar
When I drink your medicine, it just makes me sicker

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
The hounds of hell are getting closer, closer and closer
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over

Follow the rainbow, my lucky omen
There ain't no pot of gold, just copper tokens
I found the key to life, but the lock was broken
All my accomplishments are best left unspoken

I dug a hole so deep
I'm gonna drown in my mistakes
Can't even sell my soul
'Cause it ain't worth shit to take

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
The hounds of hell are getting closer, closer and closer
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over

My horror story is nearly over
I said I'm sorry, but I was sober
I beg for mercy from my infernal friend
The one that drives the nails into my coffin

I've got the devil on my shoulder
I've got the devil on my shoulder

I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over
And I just can't sink any lower, lower and lower
They've come to take me, take me over, over and over
I've got the devil on my shoulder, over and over


Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh, oh

Slapped my face, slammed the door
A dozen roses lay on the floor
I saw her friends and I was told
She blocked my number from her cell phone
You said we were meant to be
Now this obsession is killing me
Until I have a heart attack
I'll keep on trying to win you back

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance
To hold you in my arms at last

Forever, forever
I'll walk a thousand miles
Just to tell her, to tell her
Our love is still alive
And I'll never, I'll never
I'll never let it die
Well you'd better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine

I'm not so sure about this word
But she kept calling me insecure
I tried to quit but there's no use
Cause I'm addicted to her abuse
She's in control of everything
I'm just a puppet, she pulls my strings
Denying truth, I'll test my fate
And keep on playing this wicked game

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance
To hold you in my arms at last

Forever, forever
I'll walk a thousand miles
Just to tell her, to tell her
Our love is still alive
And I'll never, I'll never
I'll never let it die
Well you'd better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Waiting to explode

We're dancing on thin ice before
Frozen from the winter's cold
And if it were to crack below
I'd never let you go

Alone at last,
I can't wait 'till we're alone at last
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance
To hold you in my arms at last

Forever, forever
I'll walk a thousand miles
Just to tell her, to tell her
Our love is still alive
And I'll never, I'll never
I'll never let it die
Well you'd better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Waiting to explode

Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better not touch
She's a diamond on a landmine
Better to forget
She's a diamond on a landmine
Waiting to explode


This heart don't count on the wicked
These hands don't fight at all
This mind don't do what it's told to
These eyes don't cry at all
Don't cry at all

These eyes don't cry at all

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

We're in this city of villains
I walk these streets alone
When everyone is a stranger
They're eyes turn me to stone
Turn me to stone

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

I'm telling you tonight I swear to tear up these nails from across the bed
For giving you control of me

This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope
It turns to hope

Calling from the mountain tops
Rain is falling from the sky above
They surround you with the darkest thoughts
'til you drown in pessimistic talk

You say you don't care if the atom drops
You say you don't care if the world is lost
They'll never break you if you're strong enough
They'll never change you if you turn your anger into hope

This heart don't count on the wicked
We face this world alone
When all that want is to break you
Turn anger into hope

I'm telling you tonight I swear to tear up these nails from across the bed
For giving you control of me

This heart don't count on the wicked
This anger turns to hope

We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope
We turn it to hope


Swimming in the dark, we're bound to drift apart
And I just can't go on, pretending we're in love
We play with matches in the rain but never learn
We try to light it but the fire never burns

You thought that love was just a casting call
But it's our turn to quit before the curtain falls

Don't need to pretend to love me
You don't need to pretend to want me
You don't need to pretend to need me
We just never were meant to
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?
Lost my mind?

Now I dance around her heart, like an actor plays the part
I hit the stage and I get blinded by the light
I read the script, but I just can't recite the lines

You thought that love was just a casting call
But it's our turn to quit before the curtain falls

Don't need to pretend to love me
We just never were meant to ever be
You don't need to pretend to love me
We just never were meant to
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?

You thought that love was just a casting call
But it's our turn to quit before the curtain falls

Don't need to pretend to love me
You don't need to pretend to want me
You don't need to pretend to need me
We just never were meant to
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?

Don't need to pretend to love me
We just never were meant to ever be
You don't need to pretend to love me
We just never were meant to
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?
So get on with your life 'cause we're just wasting time
Am I wrong? Am I right or have I lost my mind?


You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you
And that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame
What a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you
And that's worse

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with

Ever fallen in love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with



In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

I hitched a ride, until the coast
To leave behind, all of my ghosts
Searching for something, I couldn't find at home

Can't get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit, and I'll be fine
I swear to God, this'll be my one last time!

In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

When it gets dark, in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head, will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead!

In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves... on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

I never once thought, I'd ever be caught!
Staring at sidewalks, hiding my track marks!
I left my best friends, or did they just leave me?

In a crooked little town, they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

Run away before you drown!
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground


Hey

Another, tragedy has 
Set the scene for conscience to be revealed
And all the February
February winds are howling

Don't tell me we're adversaries
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies
'Cause we all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

An ocean lies between us
Sufferings are constant, we never see
Behind our sanctuary
Sanctuary, walls so easy to breathe
Where is our apathy?
Has, apathy been lost while drifting at sea
We are the refugees
Don't worry we'll survive on hopes of

Don't tell me we're adversaries
Don't tell me we're sworn enemies
'Cause we all need necessary
Means to protect what we love

Light up your book of matches
Open your hearts to action
We all need second chances
What reason to help but for love?

February winds
February winds

No we are not adversaries
We were not born enemies
We all need necessary 
Means to protect what we love

Light up your book of matches
Open your hearts to action
We all need second chances
What reason to help but for love?

We are not adversaries
We are not sworn enemies
We all need necessary 
Means to protect what we love

February winds
The message that we send
Will come back in the end


(Respect!)
Is never given enough today
I'm tired of looking the other way
(Respect!)
An appetite that we can't sustain
We're on a mission to kiss our days away

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here

(Respect!)
A generation of castaways
Under a nation of tidal waves
(Respect!)
Are we the passengers or the prey?
You can't escape from the past on holiday

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Pack your bags because the tide is getting high

Don't be afraid of the view from economy class
It's just the captain and crew jumping off of the mast
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse?
Is this the point where the bomb reaches critical mass?
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

(Respect!)
Catastrophic events don't change
Today we feast, but tomorrow we pay
(Respect!)
But don't you worry cause you'll be safe
I got a ticket to piss your days away

So how long before the rivers start to rise, dear?
Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here

Don't be afraid of the view from economy class
It's just the captain and crew jumping off of the mast
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse?
Is this the point where the bomb reaches critical mass?

One city from the coast disappearing too fast
One city from the coast sunk into the past
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
One city from the coast disappearing too fast
One city from the coast, we can never come back
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats
All aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rats

Hello, hello, hello my darling, have we reached the end?
'Cause when the stitches fall apart we're hanging by a thread

Hello, hello, hello my darling, some things never change
When our words are dipped in gasoline, our love goes up in flames
I tried so hard to get behind your mental barricade
But every time it leaves me feeling damaged, torn, and frayed

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again

I'm tired of all the drama that unravels in your head
Well, it's easy to get tangled up when your world is torn to shreds
And every time you spit at me, some day you will regret
An ounce of insecurity is worth a pound of lead

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause these rags are turning red
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause I'm hanging by a thread

Hello, hello, hello my darling, have we reached the end?
'Cause when the stitches fall apart we're hanging by a thread
For all the times we've hurt each other, with all the things we've said
Well, it's hard to hold this olive branch with a gun against my head

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
When you break my heart, I fall apart 'til you stitch me up again

Hanging by a thread
Hanging by a thread
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause these rags are turning red
C'mon patch me up, or cut me loose, 'cause I'm hanging by a thread


We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
Masters of broken promises are born to manipulate
Your mind is a vault of prejudice but we see through the door
Your dirty little secrets aren't so secret anymore

We'll never drink your medicine and we'll never think your way
You're tied to an ideology from a book that's out of date
No room for your daft intolerance left in this day and age
We're not gonna go down quietly, we're not gonna be afraid

'Cause under the cloak of sanities are madmen in disguise
Are we blind, blind, blind?

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
It's a lie!

We're slamming the doors of democracy on those who are not the same
We're casting the stones of liberty, but no one takes the blame
Your cup is full of promise, but there's nothing left in mine
Tell me why, why, why?

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We're gonna make it like a thief in the night
(Are we blind?) We'll uncover up the evidence of their crimes
Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)
(It's a lie!) Well, they told me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie!) I surrendered the fight, I surrendered the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)

And what I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes
And I don't need to be tied
To the edge of your knife!

And what I need to survive
Is right in front of my eyes

(It's a lie!) I believe it but I don't understand
(It's a lie!) I feel it coming at the back of the head
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(It's a lie!) If you think you'll be the one in command
(It's a lie!) It'll tear us all apart in the end
It's a lie (lie), a lie (lie), a lie (lie)
(Are we blind?) We're gonna make it like a thief in the night

Are we blind (blind), blind (blind), blind (blind)
(It's a lie!) Well, they told me to surrender the fight
(It's a lie!) I surrendered the fight, I surrendered the fight
It's a lie (lie), lie (lie), lie (lie)
A big fucking lie!


Tired of all the promises and never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
And all the ones that bring you down, their colors weren't that true
And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
Don't wait up for that moment to arrive
Leave them all behind

Yeah, I'm tired of all the promises and never coming through
It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you
Yeah, and all the ones that bring you down, their colors weren't that true
And when you lose your confidence your mind plays tricks on you

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time

We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line

I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way
Become I'm your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change
You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight
So catch me if you can 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate

It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right
We're always searching for the reason why
And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb
We keep on getting stuck here all the time

We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind 
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind 
We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line

Oh, oh, oh
Tired of all the promises and never coming through 
Stop waiting for that moment to arrive

We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried
We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind 
We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line
We're gonna leave them all behind, We're gonna leave them all behind
We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line
Yeah!


False Conversation
Hidden agendum
You think we're stupid, how dare you
The rug has not been pulled
Over our eyes you fool
We can see right through

Tip-toeing villain
Eyes in the ceiling
Your false intentions have warn thin
But we've been in your room and in your closet too
We've got one on you

Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies

Inside an office, a fallen angel
A smilin' buddah with snake eyes
Creates the latest trends
And i just can't pretend
don't call me your friend

When all these
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed

Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies!

Lies will come back to haunt you
Bulletproof your limousine
Lies will come back to haunt you
Hit and run, a broken dream

Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed

Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies you wake up to
Lies from the alter
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed

Lies


What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
Today I don't feel pretty
And I'm tired of trying to fit right in
Don't think they're just so great
Cause being great must suck
We don't always see the bright side
We all need ego suicide
You hung my id today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on
Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So set 'em straight and finally say
What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
My heart is in the right place
So wipe that smurk right off your face
Don't make me feel like that
Cause that's just plain not nice
We don't always see the bright side
And I lied when I said I was fine
You slammed my face today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on
Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So set 'em straight and finally say
What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
You stole my luck from me
And now my fortune cookie's empty
Cause you came and you stole it all from me
So set 'em straight and finally say
What you see is what you get (don't you know)
Fishing for the answer with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget (don't you know)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers


Constant quick fixes they don't make no sense
Hop on bandwagons
You make me sick

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Distant loud chuckles they keep me awake
Awkward in stances
Won't make you hip

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

We've said this all before, your shadows at the door
We've said this all before, your shadows at the door
There's darkness in the hall and we won't take the fall
We won't take the fall

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows

Don't you tell me, what you think is right
When your living in the shadows
I can tell that, you have lost your sight
When you're living in the shadows


The song has born a brand new day
Conscience has been cast away
Evil has been blessed with prays
Heroes end up in disgrace
So who will be our savior now
That judge your angels to the ground

It's a lonely road to absolution
We must walk alone
We must walk alone

We can't take back, the days we've borrowed
No more time to kill tomorrow

No more time to kill tomorrow


Alive!
And right before your eyes!
It's easy to think twice
A choice can change your life

Angry fists, angry eyes
Thought you'd take them by surprise
And unleash all your demons upon them
With your guns, and your knives
Left them fighting to survive
You're the villain, but you play the victim

Never took no advice
Did you ever realize
That your violence had taken your virtue
Wellyou can't wash away
The mistakes of yesterday
When the boys wearing blue
Come to greet you

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down

Did you stop and regret?
When your voice inside your head
Got so quiet, that you'd hear a pen drop
Did you still like the view?
When the guns were aimed at you
Screaming out of the house with your hands up

Now you wait in the line, for the prison bell to chime
Singing "I fought the law, but the law won"
When you're done serving time 
you can look them in the eyes
While you count all the lives that you've broken

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down

And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are falling down your mother's face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Someday you'll see the life that you turned down

And I can hear the sirens still calling your name
And I can see the ashes rise up from the flames
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before all came crashing down

And I can see the flashing lights take you away
And now the tears are falling down your mother's face
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
One day before it all came crashing down
When love was still around
When love was still around
Someday you'll see the life that you turned down

Alive! 
And right before your eyes
It's easy to think twice
A choice can change your life


Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hand
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

Well the bloodsucker society, is looking for recruits
I took a sip of their sobriety, it doesn't taste that good

Well at first you're fine with working overtime
10 years go by til you're caught up in the grind
And can't escape the fact your youth is fading fast
These times won't last and once they're gone they don't come back

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hand
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

They try to fill you with anxiety, until you bite the hook
They drop a line of notoriety, they got a big cheque book

Oh they'll turn you blind for a nickel and a dime
Don't waste your time with their simple frame of mind
You can't escape the fact your youth is fading fast
These times won't last and once they're gone they don't come back

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hand
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command

Attention all personnel!
Stand single file, resistance is futile!
We're gonna raise your hopes up
Just to knock them down
You got a bright bright future
If you can shut your mouth
And if you work the front lines
To keep us safe and sound
You won't be compensated
Until you're in the ground
So don't waste a single breath
On what society expects
If history don't lie
They're gonna take you for a ride until you die!

Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
At first they'll take your liberties
Then tie them 'round your hand
Man alive!
Don't stand aside!
While people make demands
When time goes by some day you'll find
Their words are your command


Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know
Put concrete in my veins
I'd always walk home alone
So I became lifeless
Just like my telephone

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I'd have to check my mirror
To see if I'm still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches
Alone in the bathroom

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There's nothing to gain
And I can't fight the pain

Teach us that its just a phase
When I grow up my children
Will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
I know it put me under ground
At seventeen

There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
But the days don't seem to change
There's nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There's nothing to gain
And I just died today


All we shared was a mattress, and a lie, and an address
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Once occupied by a goddess, now it's a room full of boxes
She said, "it's time to leave you" but baby I don't need you!

In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

I never got the whole story, not 'til after she left me
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Word on the street is she fucked him, while we were playing in Cleveland
Well baby I don't need you, you're fading in my rearview

In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick!

Control-Alt-Deleted
Control-Alt-Deleted
Control-Alt-Deleted
Reset my memory!

In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes click!
She pulls the trigger until the gun goes...


Never understood how she could,
Mean so little to so many
Why does she mean everything to me?

Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Questioning her good intention
Jealousy's a bad invention
When you push on glass, it's bound to break

Even when she was defensive,
It just gave me more incentive
The more you squeeze, the more it slips away

I never walked so far on a lonely street
With no-one there for me
Is it worth the pain, with no one to blame?
For all of my insecurities
How did I ever let you go?

Accept this confession! I'm walking on pins and needles
You're not my possession! I'm walking on pins and needles
My conscience is vicious! I'm walking on pins and needles
And I'm begging forgiveness! I'm walking on pins and needles

I never walked so far on a lonely street,
With no one there for me
It took too long to see her in misery
And now it's clear to me

That it's worth the pain, always take the blame
For all your own insecurities
How did I ever let you go?


Vanities are only charity
And she makes donations at the Tiffany's,
Life is hard without a credit card to get by, get by
She sold her dreams for security
To a man that now she hardly ever sees
With a cold martini in her hand, she don't mind, don't mind

So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh

If you design a plastic happiness,
Then climb the social ladder to the top my friend,
And don't forget to thank the piggy bank in the sky, so high

So throw all your luxuries aside
You can't take them with you when you die
Still when I look into your
Eyes are full of dollar signs,
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail
Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh

Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail

Oh, reach, into a pocketful of dreams
Oh, now, before they fall out of the seams
Oh, take a chance, don't matter if you fail
You're too scared to try cause you might break a nail, oh


I never bite off more than I could chew 
But then she came and bit me
I never bite off more than I could chew 
But then she bit my leg
She said don't want to work I want to play and live my life like it was Sunday
The only problem is that Sunday only comes now once a week and I'm a freak but

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should I stay
A prisoner of today

My body's tight my soul's excited and I wish that I was gifted
My body's tight my souls excited and I wish I had some spunk
I want to run I want to hide and leave this place Just like it left me
The only problem is I need to find the balls to follow through and that's the truth but

We're breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should I stay a prisoner of today
No time for one another no time for one another no time for one another no time for one another

But this is our time this is our time this is our time and our place
History I history I history I can't erase
This is our time this is our time this is our time and our place

Were breaking up the city
No time for wasting away
So tell me why should I stay a prisoner.


Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Cast off the crutch that kills the pain
The red flag waving never meant the same
The kids of tomorrow don't need today
When they live in the sins of yesterday

Well I've never seen us act like this
Our only hope is the minds of kids
And they'll show us a thing or two

Our only weapons are the guns of youth
It's only time before they tighten the noose

its too late to say what your doing is killing me
now too soon to pay
where i willingly
where you stand there with somebody else
by yourside
while, the man inside of me 
has died
died
died

somebody give me a mirror
so i can check myself
a reflective jumpkick
back to reality

its a shock to my system
called you on your own
cause you mean so much to me
I dont want things to change but how
can things forever stay the same
cant invision where this is going

somebody give me a mirror
so i can check myself
a reflective jumpkick back
to reality

ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
ahhhhhhh
ahahhhhhhhaaaaaaa

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Ohhhhhhhh
whoaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
no no no no!
whoaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh



Rejected since day one
My name is bastard son
I've been damned so many times I've lost count
Blue collar, working man
Devises master-plan
Bipolar with a mental side arm

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken; you can't fix it
Don't make me 'cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below, running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame

Contraption made of bones
Nuts and bolts creates the
New monster to burn your family tree down
Tick-tocking--time's up now
Split second--the world frowns
Lonely heart--never had nobody

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken; you can't fix it
Don't make me 'cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below, I'm running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below

Into the river below, I'm running from the inferno
You'll think I'm insane, but you'll all know my name
Into the river below, running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame
Yeah, I'll take all the blame, the front page, and the fame


It's up to you!
This ain't no TV show
You watch my head explode
Ten thousand hours every day

No time to be afraid
Chase up the rattle snakes
Don't let your fear control your fate

The ghost of self denial
It whispers from the grave
The road you can't rely on
Is a risk that you must take

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Pulling the blindfolds back
All we did in life

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
We're gonna escape this trap
Gotta get a life

Stuck in this prison cell
Just like a criminal
I count the years that went to waste

If this road goes to hell
I'm right back where I fell
Made a career from my mistakes

The ghost of self denial
It whispers from the grave
The road you can't rely on
Could be your saving grace

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Pulling the blindfolds back
All we did in life

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
We're gonna escape this trap
Gotta get a life

And every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every leg that I have to break
(These scars are mine, These scars are mine)
And everyday that I'd pray for you
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
At least I can say that we made it through
(The stars aligned, The stars aligned)
The stars aligned
The stars aligned

And words just can't explain the struggle of a dead men's fight
A dead mens fight
And silver spoons get by the wasted mother hard earns life
A hard earns life

Every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every leg that I have to break
(These scars are mine, These scars are mine)
And everyday that I'd pray for you
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
And I hope that you make it through
Yeah, I hope that you make through
It's up to you!

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Pulling the blindfolds back
All we did in life

I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
Oh, I'm running across the tracks,
(And I'm never coming back)
We're gonna escape this trap
Gotta get a life

And every step that I aim to take
(I fall behind, I fall behind)
And every leg that I have to break
(These scars are mine, These scars are mine)
And everyday that I'd pray for you
(I close my eyes, I close my eyes)
At least I can say that we made it through
(The stars aligned, The stars aligned)
The stars aligned


I stumble through the wreckage, rusted from the rain
There's nothing left to salvage, no one left to blame
Among the broken mirrors, I don't look the same
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Dissect me 'till my blood runs down into the drain
My bitter heart is pumping oil into my veins
I'm nothing but a tin man, don't feel any pain
I don't feel any pain, I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

You hung me like a picture, now I'm just a frame
I used to be a lap dog, now I'm just a stray
Shackled in a graveyard, left here to decay
Left here to decay, left here to decay
I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain

Go on, crush me like a flower, rusted from the rain
Come on strip me of my powers, beat me with your chains
And if I'm the King of cowards, you're the Queen of pain
I'm rusted from the rain, I'm rusted from the rain


They found an empty bottle on her windowsill
The day her mother lost her sleeping pills
She was sick and tired of being invisible
Hard to see in color when you're miserable

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough to hold onto us
We're still right here by your side

No one ever thought that she was capable
And the damage done is irreversible
Now she clings to life inside a hospital
Like she's trapped inside a frozen waterfall
Always said her life was never meant to be
Stuck here living someone else's dream
Well beyond your window there is so much more
Even every prison has a open door

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
So be strong enough to hold onto us
It's just not your time to die

And while the angels sleep
All of the devils are awake
Waiting to steal your love
Right outside of Heaven's gate
And all the sacred hearts
Can't numb the feeling from the pain
Cause when the drugs don't work
You're gonna curse His holy name
Damn God, yeah, God, yeah
Damn God, yeah, God, yeah

Veronika, Saint Veronika
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
We're still right here by your side
So be strong enough to hold onto us
You can't leave this world behind
Oh Veronika, Saint Veronika
It's just not your time to die


Put me on an aeroplane
A million miles away
She's opened up a book of hate
And tore a brand new page

Tonight I'll find a wishing well
Tomorrow's a new day
Tonight I'll find a wishing well before it's too late

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

She questioned my ability
To learn from my mistakes
I said she'd need a guillotine
To put me in my place

Tonight I'll write my eulogy
Before I fade away
Tonight I'll write my eulogy so don't be afraid

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

And every time I close my eyes, I've lost another day
Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?

The waves came crashing down fast
And when the storm was over the sky turned black
And now I pray for sunshine
I pray for sunshine
I pray you'll help me to escape

Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?
Show me the way
Show me the way
Spent a whole lifetime running away

And every time I close my eyes, I've lost another day
Show me the way
Show me the way
Why do my dreams keep slipping away?

Every time we close our eyes, we've lost another day
Every time we close our eyes, our dreams will have to end


In a garage, beside a house, there is a luxury Sedan
And for his next monthly installment, 
He's gonna go out with a bang!
Boy who always did what he was told,
Was promised to be king when he was old

Hit the brakes, hit the glass,
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past,
Flashed before his face

There is a man, intensive care
When he awakes he will declare,
"I've been dead for 20 years! 
I won't let 20 more go by..."
Boy who always did what he was told,
Bought the only dream that he was sold

Hit the brakes, Hit the glass,
Time to shake the hands of fate
The mistakes of the past,
Flashed before his face

Burn the evidence... of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence... of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence... of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence... of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Ever feel like you've been cheated,
Following what they believe?
Don't shake the hands of fate,
Don't shake the hands of fate,
There's no more time to waste!

Ever feel like you've been cheated,
Following what they believe?
Don't shake the hands of fate,
There's no more time to waste!

Burn the evidence... of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence... of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence... of my existence,
Clear the ashes on the ground
Burn the evidence... of all these things,
That pull my spirit down

Burn the evidence!
Burn the evidence! 
Burn the evidence! 
Don't shake the hands of fate!
Burn the evidence! 
Burn the evidence! 
Burn the evidence! 
There's no more time to waste!


Oh I had a feeling
Buried inside
Covered beneath your
Blanket of pride
Oh I couldn't tell you
how numb I felt inside
In so little time

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my arms

Chasing the bright lights
This city got old
You walked out of my life
and into the cold
It's hard to imagine that you'd
never come home
Forever alone

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my arms

Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Stand up and run
Into my heart

Can't you see there is not logic to love?
And we're lost just like the stars up above
If I'd only known how you'd make me feel
I would kiss the ground that touches your heel
After all these years of being apart
Don't let reason try to tear us apart
If the compass strikes then follow your heart
And I hope it leads your right back into my arms

(Stand up and run)
And the time has past
(Stand up and run)
We'll still make it last
(Stand up and run)
And I hope this leads you right back into my arms
Oh into my arms

Oh I had a feeling
Buried inside


My head, it hurts
Each day it's getting worse
My looks and smile
Have now become my curse
Tight lips, red skirt
The never ending street
Big car, little man
My lover for a fee

So if you see me will you just drive on by
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye
And did you want me? Well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' through my veins

My head it hurts
Each day its getting worse
No sun, my room
Has now become my hearse
Cold sores, I'm beat
Got bruises on my feet
My pride, these men
Have taken it from me

So if you see me will you just drive on by
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye
And did you want me? Well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' through my veins

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' through my veins

So if you see me will you just drive on by
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye
And did you want me? Well I guess I want you
Oh pretty baby how could you?

Standing in the rain
Standing in the rain
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Mother, I have lost my way
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug-shot baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops runnin' though my veins
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way


Well I'm scared of my reflection
Is it mine or is it yours?
And I swear I hear the knockin'
But there's no one at the door.

Don't think I'm losing my perspective
Cause I know one thing for sure
They've been watching, they've been listening
Every whisper, every word

[Chorus]
Your sudden movements, sudden movements
Gonna give us all away
No sudden movements, sudden movements
Or they'll blow us all away

Dare I find my information
Who's the black sheep of the herd?
I am the guardian of angels
And they'll get what they deserve

So lock your children in the basement
Keep a rifle by the door
Don't be afraid of my intentions
Cause I'm more afraid of yours

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Blow our soul away
Blow our soul away

[Chorus:Repeat x2]


You got the look, but not the credit
They wrote the book, on how to sell it

From cigarettes, to skinny jeans
You got the money, they got the means

Oh you upper class daughters, and working class sons
It's hard to save a dollar, the way the world runs
You're the target market of a corporate joke
It won't be so ironic when your daddy is broke

Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
You're much better looking when you're in disguise
Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
And this revolution has been brought to you by

Just gotta stop, so you can mimic
The tortured artist, the jaded cynic

The latest gadget, is just a gimmick
Another sucker, born every minute

Well I'm sick of this town, bringing me down
A vast world epidemic all around
I'm sick of this town, bringing me down
A lost generation trying to act profound

Oh you upper class daughters, and working class sons
It's hard to save a dollar the way the world runs
We got a counterculture you can buy of a shelf
If you're losing your identity to somebody else

Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
You're much better looking when you're in disguise
Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
And this revolution has been brought to you by
Those who seek to think we don't care
And those who seek to think we're not aware
Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
You're much better looking when you're in disguise

Call the ranks,
Call the ranks,
Call the ranks

Oh you working class daughters, and upper class sons
It's hard to save a dollar the way the world runs
We're the target market of a corporate hoax
Our generation is a fucking joke

Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
You're much better looking when you're in disguise
Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
And this revolution has been brought to you by
Those who seek to think we don't care
And those who seek to think we're not aware
Surprise surprise, surprise surprise
You're much better looking when you're in disguise


She reads a book from across the street
Waiting for someone that she'll never meet
Talk over coffee for an hour or two
She wonders why I'm always in a good mood

Killing time before she struts her stuff
She needs support and I've become the crutch
She'll never know how much she means to me
I'd play the game but I'm the referee

(Surrender) every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) all the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) all the hope that I lost, it was found
(Surrender) yourself to me

Even though I know what I'm looking for
She's got a brick wall behind her door
I'd travel time and confess to her
But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger

(Surrender) every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) all the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) all the hope that I lost, you have found
(Surrender) yourself to me

I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
I think I found a flower in a field of weeds
Searching until my hands bleed
This flower don't belong to me
This flower don't belong to me
Why can't she belong to me?

Every word, every thought, every sound
Every touch, every smile, every frown
All the pain we've endured until now
All the hope that I lost, you have found

(Surrender) every word, every thought, every sound
(Surrender) every touch, every smile, every frown
(Surrender) all the pain we've endured until now
(Surrender) all the hope that I lost, you have found

(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask
(Surrender) Has my moment come and passed?
(Surrender) I never had the nerve to ask


We spent our lives together
It should have last forever
But now it's time to sail on

So take this anchor from my heart
So we can finally drift apart
Before we drown in sorrow

I gave you sanctuary
Under the sun we lived care free
I tried so hard to love you

But then you turned your back on me
Your good intentions turned to greed
And now it's great to know that you have bee

Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed oh

The bluest skies turned into grey
Through tortured eyes I watched you change
A paradise went up in flames
And though I cried a thousand times
You didn't hear the lies in time
There's nowhere left to hide since you have been

Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed oh

Your devastation took it's toll
As the waves came crashing to the coast
This sinking ship, I'm taking back from your control

It felt so good to cross my arms and renounce my faith in mankind
How could you ever be so blind to think that you survive

Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
I hope you know that nothing matters
Now that you have been
Swallowed up by the ocean
Swallowed up by the ocean
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
I hope you know this ship has finally come to rest
Oh, I hope you know someday this ship will be your end


A slap in the face,
And I can't erase,
These things that you say,
Don't make it all okay, it's not okay

When push comes to shove,
I'll put on the gloves,
Intentions are cruel,
I ain't nobody's fool you know

It hurts, my pride, step aside,
'Cause I don't need your...

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me!
Misery
That's what you're giving me!
Sympathy
It's just like trickery!
Breaking me down

A fistful of lies,
Dressed up in disguise,
And make no mistake,
I know they're all so fake, they're all so fake
My self-righteous friend,
I just can't pretend,
Your words are the truth,
Sincere only when they suit you

It hurts, my pride, step aside,
'Cause I don't need your...

Sympathy!
Won't get the best of me
Misery!
That's what your giving me
Sympathy!
It's just like trickery
Breaking me down

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me!
Misery
This shit is killing me!
Sympathy
It's just like trickery!
Breaking me down

Breaking me down


The gun is loaded when the glass is full
Down the hatch and the trigger's pulled
Off the wagon and back onto the stool
I know that when I stare into your eyes
I can see all the years of lies
Ghosts and demons you never exorcised

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone

Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

His fate was written on a neon sign
A DUI never changed his mind
He got hooked like a fish caught on a line
You never gave yourself a chance to shine
Your destination's a chalk outline
And when you get to the gates you'll be denied

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
And I'm in the crowd but I'm all alone

Oh Lord, I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

All the friends that I've ever known
Are the streetlamps I follow home
The tide keeps pulling me down
I try to reach higher ground
I'll never give up and drown

Even though I just can't
Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine

Tear the moon from the stars tonight
Twist my arm like a knife tonight
And if you wanna leave that's alright
Well I'll just turn these tears into wine
Tears into wine
Tears into wine
Well, I'll just turn these tears into wine


I should have turned and walked away
But I got tangled in your chains
A trail of dead for all to see
You shut the cage and stole the key

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

I spill my blood on the checkered floor
You got me crawling back for more
You set the trap, I'll take the bait
A bed of nails I can't escape

Your state of mind revealed
That my love for you was real
They say in time wounds heal
But I got nothing left to steal

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

Now it's so dark that I can't see
The mental scars you left on me
So dig your nails and grind your teeth
I'm in your clutch for eternity

Yeah, I know it's hard for you to see
The mental scars you left on me
So dig your nails and grind your teeth
I'm in your clutch for eternity

My mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal

Oh, my mouth is shut, my lips are sealed
You are the crutch of this disease
And I've been locked in your machine
Sit here and rot, or break this deal


Let the rain fall down, let it fall to the ground,
Let the rain fall down to the ground.
And the birds don't sing, no they don't make a sound,
When you're six feet underground.

Well they cast me out when the word spread around
That I never sang in the church.
And it took one night for the town to decide
I'm afflicted by the curse.

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground.
And the birds don't sing, no they don't make a sound.
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why,
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

So they marched me down to the center of town,
With their pitchforks high in the air.
I was chained and bound with a blindfold around
So the judge wouldn't catch my stare.
And they hung my soul from the gallows pole
But the witch they never found.
So to those who don't fit society's mold,
Learn to swim or you will drown.

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground.
And the birds don't sing, no they don't make a sound.
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why,
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

And the angels sing "let it shine, let it shine"
Dry the teardrops from my eyes.
And the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind,
'Cause the dead can't testify.
And because I can't take an eye for an eye,
In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'till you die!

And the rain falls down, let it fall to the ground
(Let teardrops hit the ground!)
And the birds don't sing, no they don't make a sound
(When you're six feet underground!)
So I look to the sky, tell me why, tell me why,
Do they all get to live, and I have to die?

And the angels sing "let it shine, let it shine"
Dry the teardrops from my eyes.
And the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind,
'Cause the dead can't testify.
And because I can't take an eye for an eye,
In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'till you die!

In the afterlife I'll haunt you 'till you die!


Well, I looked at her face and then I knew she changed
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!

So I sat in my room for twenty seven days,
No she never called, I had something to say!
No she never called, I had something to say!

I don't know much and I don't know how

Why would she put me through such torture,
I would have given my life for her,
She was the one that knocked me over,
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner

Well, I heard she's great and her new boyfriend's lame,
She can go to hell I'll never be the same!
She can go to hell I'll never be the same!

And these open wounds will heal with time they say,
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!

I don't know much and I don't know how

Why would she put me through such torture,
I would have given my life for her,
She was the one that knocked me over,
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner


Time rolling along with the waves,
A thousand miles away
Holding you close in the rain,
Seems just like yesterday

Lost hope in a faraway place
And in my hand remains,
A black and white print of a face,
I'll never see again

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Cut down like lambs at slaughter,
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Love served until death do us part,
I'm drifting in the dark
Wounded and wishing to fall,
Into your faithful arms

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter,
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all

Beneath the sky of hate,
Beyond the sea of pain,
In heaven I will wait,
Until we meet again

I gave my life to save her
The ocean turned to red
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
Cut down like lambs at slaughter,
Good men were left for dead
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all
In the fall, in the fall, when the tide took them all


Everybody is tired
And poor and sick of trying
If you see me
On the corner
Will you stop or will you splash me
Take a look at
What we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family
On a post card
Picture perfect, I don't want it

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

Shitty weather, bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found
Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes
This is, how it, it goes

So unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Unscrew my head
And rinse it out
Polish my thoughts
Turn into doubts
Turn 'em into, turn 'em into doubts

So I hold my breath 'til my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes


Once there was a nation here
Now there is no more
Once we fought to change our fears
But now this is our war (This is our war)
This is our war

Wash your mind out, where's your morals?
How many people have to live this sorrow?
Life should not be begged or borrowed
How many really want to change tomorrow?

We're still playing the prideful game 
As we profile the enemy that we created
We're still playing the prideful game 
With the cards on the table 
In the end we're all the same
Where's the compassion in the world today?
Yeah, we're all the same
Until we find another way 
This is our war (This is our war)

Once there was a nation here
Now there is no more (This is our war)
Once we fought for change arm in arm
But now this is our war

Divisive words from ivory towers
Seeds of intolerance turn into flowers
Countless fools and reckless cowards
Rally the people in the quest for power

We're still playing the prideful game 
As we profile the enemy that we created
We're still playing the prideful game 
With the cards on the table 
In the end we're all the same
Where's the compassion in the world today?
Yeah, we're all the same
Until we find another way 
This is our war (This is our war)

Once there was a nation here
Now there is no more (This is our war) 
Once we fought for change arm in arm
But now this is our war

Is this the land of segregation? 
Is this a place that we call home? 
Don't let the old style generation 
Carry the flag for you and me no more
This is our war
This is our war

We're into the red, We're into the red 
And as it burns the fire spreads
We're under the threat, We're under the threat 
Will it still burn tomorrow?

Once there was a nation here 
Now there is no more
Once we fought to change our fears
But now this is our war (This is our war)

Once there was a nation here
Now there is no more (This is our war) 
Once we fought for change arm in arm
But now this is our war

Is this the land of segregation? 
Is this a place that we call home?
Don't let the old style generation 
Carry the flag for you and me no more (This is our war) 

Once there was a nation divided 
Now this is our war (This is our war) 
Once we stand embraced arm in arm
We stand for something more


Like a dagger drawn across my chest,
Shoots a bullet in Russian roulette,
You said you'd never turn your back on me,
Rescue me, rescue me,
Would you stand by me and bury me?
Bury me,
Why don't we end this lie,
I can't pretend this time,
I need a friend to find my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces!!

Every time you try to leave me blind,
You'll never close my eyes,
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die!!

And when she spins the bottle round and round,
Every time it leaves me kept and bound,
You said you'd never turn your back on me,
Rescue me, rescue me,
Would you stand by me and bury me?
Bury me,
Why don't we end this lie,
I can't pretend this time,
I need a friend to find my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces!!

End this lie I cant pretend,
This time I need a friend to find my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces,
Every time you try to leave me blind,
You'll never close my eyes,
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die!!

Misery won't get the best of me,
Cause now I'm calling, yes I'm calling on your bluff!!

Misery won't get the best of me,
Cause now I'm calling, yes I'm calling on your bluff!!

Don't tell your lies I've had enough!!!

Why don't we end this lie,
I can't pretend this time,
I need a friend to find my broken mind,
Before it falls to pieces,
Every time you try to leave me blind,
You'll never close my eyes,
You'll never close my eyes and watch me die,

End this lie I cant pretend,
This time I need a friend to find my broken mind,

I tripped, I fell down naked
I scratched my knees, they bled
Sew up my eyes need no more
In our game there is no score

Forgive me father why should ya bother
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony

I'm insane it's your fault, so sly
Your well of lies ran dry
I cut the cord, free fall
From so high we seem so small

Forgive me father, why should ya bother
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dump truck
Reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheap skate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony
Cry agony

I'm insane, it's your fault, cry!
I'm insane, you're so, sly!

Forgive me father, why should ya bother now?
Forgive me father, why should ya bother now?

Forgive me father, why should ya bother
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me.
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony

Cry agony, cry agony
Cry agony, cry agony
Cry agony, cry agony


And when the clock strikes 12, tell me where you gonna be?
Cleaning up the mess we've made or watching your TV?
And if you have to ask, then you don't have a clue,
There's snow in Arizona while they're bombing in Beirut!

I hope some day, when I'm dead and gone,
We learn to right, everything that's wrong,
With loving hands, turn sick to strong,
Our time will tell, if life goes on, on, on, on, on

When the storm hits your front door, with a roar you can't ignore,
You run, run, away, but there's no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night, you don't got no chance to fight,
'Cause you're too late, so kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

It just don't make no sense, there's a million mouthes to feed,
We got military action over monetary need
And you can turn your back, or you can plant the seed
You can choose compassion over universal greed

I hope some day, when I'm dead and gone,
We learn to right, everything that's wrong,
With loving hands, turn sick to strong,
Our time will tell, if life goes on, on, on, on, on

When the storm hits your front door, with a roar you can't ignore,
You run, run, away  but there's no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night, you don't got no chance to fight,
Cause you're too late, so kiss your ass goodbye, mate!

And you can turn your back, but it won't go away
And you don't look scared, but you should be afraid
You can shut your mouth, but you still have a say
And you just don't care, for tomorrow, today

And you can turn your back, but it won't go away
And you don't look scared, but you should be afraid
You can shut your mouth, but you still have a say
And you just don't care, for tomorrow, today

Well no way, way
No way, no way, no way, no way!

When the storm hits your front door, with a roar you can't ignore,
You run, run, away, but there's no place to hide, mate!
When the days turn into night, you don't got no chance to fight,
Cause you're too late, so kiss your ass goodbye, mate!


Down, let's take it down
Raise up the heads on a stake
We will show no mercy
On evolution's mistake

Change, will have to wait
If we can't decide on a fate
Self appointed profits
And a doomsday charade

You preach about love
And teach about fate
But all your beliefs are still rooted in hate

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Stop, punch in the clock
Punch it with all of your rage
Put the men in office
For a minimum wage

Rats, fighting for scraps
Siphon the gas from your tank
Left your pockets empty
As they laughed at the bank

They speak about draws
But make no mistake
They shaking your head while they spit in your face

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Now, the time is now
We can still turn it around
Raise your voice like a weapon
Til they fall to the ground

Light, let there be light
Without a shadow of doubt
We will fight tooth and nail until
Salvation is found

So how can you look
The world in the eyes
When all we can see is corruption and lies

And down on your knees you just don't look so tall 
And down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crackin the whip on the backs of the poor
We asked you to stop but you still wanted more
The blood on your hands left a trail as you crawl
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall

Crosses to burn
Axes to fall
Down on your knees you just don't look so tall (x3)

Crosses to bend
Crosses to burn
Down on your knees, you don't look so tall
Open your eyes and the empire falls


Don't wait for a knight in shinin' armor
Your savior's reflected in the mirror
These flowers have grown from blood stains on the ground
Go rake the leaves off your grass and my grave
The fact is everyone bleeds when they shave
There's no use, so don't deny their just the same

We'll take it back (broken dagger, southern swagger)
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (broken dagger, southern swagger)
Voice of violence, voices of violence

These cowboys will run off in the sun set
Once there toys have donned another profit 
Back fire these smokin' guns will never rest
Unleash the skeletons from the closet
These strangers like friends that you've never met 
They'll send them sympathies with a Hallmark card 

We'll take it back (broken dagger, southern swagger)
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (broken dagger, southern swagger)
Voices of violence, voices of violence

Even after I'm dead and buried 
I'll still remember, I'll still remember 
Even after I'm dead and buried 
I'll still remember, I'll still remember 
Even after I'm dead and buried 
I'll come back for fighting, I'll come back fighting!!

Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back (broken dagger, southern swagger)
Voices of violence, voices of violence

Voices of violence will always be heard 
Voices of violence, voices of violence
Voices of violence will always be heard
Voices of violence, voices of violence


I am a patient boy 
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait 
My time is like water down a drain 
Everybody's moving, 
Everybody's moving,
Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving
Please don't leave me to remain 
In the waiting room 
I don't want the news 
I cannot use it 
I don't want the news 
I won't live by it
Sitting outside of town 
Everybody's always down 
Tell me why?
Because... they can't get up 
Ahhh... Come on and get up
Come on and get up
But I don't sit idly by 
Ahhh...
I'm planning a big surprise 
I'm gonna fight for what I want to be 
I won't make the same mistakes 
Because I know
Because I know how much time that wastes 
And Function
Function is the key 
To the the waiting room
I don't want the news 
I cannot use it 
I don't want the news 
I won't live by it
Sitting outside of town 
Everybody's always down 
Tell me why?
Because... they can't get up
Ahhh... Come on and get up
Up for the waiting room
Sitting in the waiting room
Ahhh...
Sitting in the waiting room
Ahhh...
Sitting in the waiting room
Ahhh...
Sitting in the waiting room
Ahhh...
Tell me why?
Because... they can't get up


Another F again I fret, 
Another cocky hypocrite, 
Another dirty look from a passer by. 
Kiddie porn and lunatics 
All the things that make me sick, 
Another suicide from a sad rock star. 

So get the fuck out of my face,
And disappear without a trace. 
You annoying little prick. 
I'll reach into my bag of tricks, 
and pull out a hand grenade. 
Your machoism fades away.
But I will not pull out the pin, 
BECAUSE THAT'S MEAN

With judgment day not far way, 
You're surfing all your days away. 
I don't know who to blame, 
Is it me or is it you?
Violent death and viruses, 
And lack thereof, of consciousness, 
Another shitty song on the radio. 

I'll kick the teeth out of your face. 
I killed the cat there's no more chase. 
You push on me I'll push you back. 
So come on, let's go attack. 
Cause this is it I've had my fill. 
Don't find yourself inside a pill. 
But I will not pull out my gun, 
CAUSE I DON'T OWN ONE

Why can't you just let me be
I said
Why can't you just let me be
Why can't you just let me be
Why can't you just let me


Urban Hipster, the new gangster frontin' by the club
A new wave mannequins packin' haircuts, instead of packin' guns
Magazines form overseas, won't teach you how to feel
They trade in their hearts for Indie rock charts to tell them what is real

When did they assume putting on a costume?
Gave them a right to ostracize
Out of the woodwork, art aficionados

She sells street cred with no smile, at the local record store
She's acting the role and dressing the part, pretending to be bored
The truth about conformity is it bites without a sting
Trends come and go but when you're alone it doesn't mean a thing

'Cause some of us aren't blind

Where is the line? Where is the line?
To be your self is not a crime
Where is the Line? Where is the line?
'Cause some of us aren't blind

Today I walked down our old street
Past the diner where we'd meet
Now I dine alone in our old seats
The cold wind blows right through my bones
And I feel like I'm getting old
But I wish I was getting old with you
I held your hand when we took shelter from the rain
She laughed as we picked out our children's names

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

Her clothes hang in the closet still
The phone sits on the windowsill
And every time it rings it gives me chills
My heart just stopped when I was told
Doctor, doctor, on the phone
Said my love was never coming home
I hold your casket gently walking to the grave
Dark clouds eclipse the sun won't shine again

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain, crying in pain

And I'm not looking for answers
No, I'm not looking for answers
But dear God, why did you choose her?

White sparrows fell from heaven and carried her away
Black arrows cut the strings of my heart, I kneel and pray

They gave her one more day
To say the words I couldn't say
I'm crying in pain (crying in pain)
Crying in pain
Our love will remain
I'm crying in pain


March on, worker bees!
Know your enemy!

We take our orders given by the queen
We're not the killers, we're the worker bees
If you resist us you will feel our sting
Surrender now before the swarm sets in

Protect the hive from enemies!
Protect the hive from enemies!
Follow the herd mentality!
Can we fight to save our souls?

March on, worker bees!
Know your enemy!

A pollination coming from the west,
And in a flash we will invade your nest
Supply of honey flowing bottomless
Play by our rules or you'll be powerless

Protect the hive from enemies!
Protect the hive from enemies!
Follow the herd mentality!
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march... along, with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride... the rails, with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord... above, forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march... along, with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride... the rails, with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord... above, forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?

Can we fight to save our souls?
Will we die to save our home?
